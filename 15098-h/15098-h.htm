 <h2>PREFACE.</h2>

 <p>The present work closes a series of studies on the literary
 preparation for the French Revolution. It differs from the companion
 volumes on Voltaire and Rousseau, in being much more fully
 descriptive. In the case of those two famous writers, every educated
 reader knows more or less of their performances. Of Diderot and his
 circle, such knowledge cannot be taken for granted, and I have
 therefore thought it best to occupy a considerable space, which I hope
 that those who do me the honour to read these pages will not find
 excessive, with what is little more than transcript or analysis. Such
 a method will at least enable the reader to see what those ideas
 really were, which the social and economic condition of France on the
 eve of the convulsion made so welcome to men. The shortcomings of the
 encyclopædic group are obvious enough. They have lately been
 emphasised in the ingenious and one-sided exaggerations of that
 brilliant man of letters, Mr. Taine. The social significance and the
 positive quality of much of their writing is more easily missed, and
 this side of their work it has been one of my principal objects, alike
 in the case of Voltaire, of Rousseau, and of Diderot, to bring into
 the prominence that it deserves in the history of opinion.</p>

 <p>The edition of Diderot's works to which the references are made, is
 that in twenty volumes by the late Mr. Assézat and Mr. Maurice
 Tourneux. The only other serious book on Diderot with which I am
 acquainted is Rosenkranz's valuable <i>Diderot's Leben</i>, published
 in 1866, and abounding in full and patient knowledge. Of the numerous
 criticisms on Diderot by Raumer, Arndt, Hettner, Damiron, Bersot, and
 above all by Mr. Carlyle, I need not make more particular mention.</p>

 <p>NOTE.</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>Since the following pages were printed, an American correspondent
  writes to me with reference to the dialogue between Franklin and
  Raynal, mentioned on page 218, Vol. II.:—"I have now before me Volume
  IV. of the <i>American Law Journal</i>, printed at Philadelphia in
  the year 1813, and at page 458 find in full, 'The Speech of Miss
  Polly Baker, delivered before a court of judicature in
  <i>Connecticut</i>, where she was prosecuted.'" Raynal, therefore,
  would have been right if instead of Massachusetts he had said
  Connecticut; and either Franklin told an untruth, or else Silas
  Deane.</p>

 <h2>DIDEROT.<br />
 <a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />
 PRELIMINARY.</h2>

 <p>There was a moment in the last century when the Gallican church
 hoped for a return of internal union and prosperity. This brief era of
 hope coincided almost exactly with the middle of the century. Voltaire
 was in exile at Berlin. The author of the Persian Letters and the
 Spirit of Laws was old and near his end. Rousseau was copying music in
 a garret. The Encyclopædia was looked for, but only as a literary
 project of some associated booksellers. The Jansenists, who had been
 so many in number and so firm in spirit five-and-twenty years earlier,
 had now sunk to a small minority of the French clergy. The great
 ecclesiastical body at length offered an unbroken front to its rivals,
 the great judicial bodies. A patriotic minister was indeed audacious
 enough to propose a tax upon ecclesiastical property, but the Church
 fought the battle and won. Troops had just been despatched to hunt and
 scatter the Protestants of the desert, and bigots exulted in the
 thought of pastors swinging on gibbets, and heretical congregations
 fleeing for their lives before the fire of orthodox musketry. The
 house of Austria had been forced to suffer spoliation at the hands of
 the infidel Frederick, but all the world was well aware that the
 haughty and devout Empress-Queen would seize a speedy opportunity of
 taking a crushing vengeance; France would this time be on the side of
 righteousness and truth. For the moment a churchman might be pardoned
 if he thought that superstition, ignorance, abusive privilege, and
 cruelty were on the eve of the smoothest and most triumphant days that
 they had known since the Reformation.</p>

 <p>We now know how illusory this sanguine anticipation was destined to
 prove, and how promptly. In little more than forty years after the
 triumphant enforcement of the odious system of confessional
 certificates, then the crowning event of ecclesiastical supremacy,
 Paris saw the Feast of the Supreme Being, and the adoration of the
 Goddess of Reason. The Church had scarcely begun to dream before she
 was rudely and peremptorily awakened. She found herself confronted by
 the most energetic, hardy, and successful assailants whom the spirit
 of progress ever inspired. Compared with the new attack, Jansenism was
 no more than a trifling episode in a family quarrel. Thomists and
 Molinists became as good as confederates, and Quietism barely seemed a
 heresy. In every age, even in the very depth of the times of faith,
 there had arisen disturbers of the intellectual peace. Almost each
 century after the resettlement of Europe by Charlemagne had procured
 some individual, or some little group, who had ventured to question
 this or that article of the ecclesiastical creed, to whom broken
 glimpses of new truth had come, and who had borne witness against the
 error or inconsistency or inadequateness of old ways of thinking. The
 questions which presented themselves to the acuter minds of a hundred
 years ago, were present to the acuter minds who lived hundreds of
 years before that. The more deeply we penetrate into the history of
 opinion, the more strongly are we tempted to believe that in the great
 matters of speculation no question is altogether new, and hardly any
 answer is altogether new. But the Church had known how to deal with
 intellectual insurgents, from Abelard in the twelfth century down to
 Giordano Bruno and Vanini in the seventeenth. They were isolated; they
 were for the most part submissive; and if they were not, the arm of
 the Church was very long and her grasp mortal. And all these
 meritorious precursors were made weak by one cardinal defect, for
 which no gifts of intellectual acuteness could compensate. They had
 the scientific idea, but they lacked the social idea. They could have
 set opinion right about the efficacy of the syllogism, and the virtue
 of entities and quiddities. They could have taught Europe earlier than
 the Church allowed it to learn that the sun does not go round the
 earth, and that it is the earth which goes round the sun. But they
 were wholly unfitted to deal with the prodigious difficulties of moral
 and social direction. This function, so immeasurably more important
 than the mere discovery of any number of physical relations, it was
 the glory of the Church to have discharged for some centuries with as
 much success as the conditions permitted. We are told indeed by
 writers ignorant alike of human history and human nature, that only
 physical science can improve the social condition of man. The common
 sense of the world always rejects this gross fallacy. The acquiescence
 for so many centuries in the power of the great directing organisation
 of Western Europe, notwithstanding its intellectual inadequateness,
 was the decisive expression of that rejection.</p>

 <p>After the middle of the last century the insurrection against the
 pretensions of the Church and against the doctrines of Christianity
 was marked in one of its most important phases by a new and most
 significant feature. In this phase it was animated at once by the
 scientific idea and by the social idea. It was an advance both in
 knowledge and in moral motive. It rested on a conception which was
 crude and imperfect enough, but which was still almost, like the great
 ecclesiastical conception itself, a conception of life as a whole.
 Morality, positive law, social order, economics, the nature and limits
 of human knowledge, the constitution of the physical universe, had one
 by one disengaged themselves from theological explanations. The final
 philosophical movement of the century in France, which was represented
 by Diderot, now tended to a new social synthesis resting on a purely
 positive basis. If this movement had only added to its other contents
 the historic idea, its destination would have been effectually
 reached. As it was, its leaders surveyed the entire field with as much
 accuracy and with as wide a range as their instruments allowed, and
 they scattered over the world a set of ideas which at once entered
 into energetic rivalry with the ancient scheme of authority. The great
 symbol of this new comprehensiveness in the insurrection was the
 Encyclopædia.</p>

 <p>The Encyclopædia was virtually a protest against the old
 organisation, no less than against the old doctrine. Broadly stated,
 the great central moral of it all was this: that human nature is good,
 that the world is capable of being made a desirable abiding-place, and
 that the evil of the world is the fruit of bad education and bad
 institutions. This cheerful doctrine now strikes on the ear as a
 commonplace and a truism. A hundred years ago in France it was a
 wonderful gospel, and the beginning of a new dispensation. It was the
 great counter-principle to asceticism in life and morals, to formalism
 in art, to absolutism in the social ordering, to obscurantism in
 thought. Every social improvement since has been the outcome of that
 doctrine in one form or another. The conviction that the character and
 lot of man are indefinitely modifiable for good, was the indispensable
 antecedent to any general and energetic endeavour to modify the
 conditions that surround him. The omnipotence of early instruction, of
 laws, of the method of social order, over the infinitely plastic
 impulses of the human creature—this was the maxim which brought men of
 such widely different temperament and leanings to the common
 enterprise. Everybody can see what wide and deep-reaching bearings
 such a doctrine possessed; how it raised all the questions connected
 with psychology and the formation of character; how it went down to
 the very foundation of morals; into what fresh and unwelcome sunlight
 it brought the articles of the old theology; with what new importance
 it clothed all the relations of real knowledge and the practical arts;
 what intense interest it lent to every detail of economics and
 legislation and government.</p>

 <p>The deadly chagrin with which churchmen saw the encyclopedic fabric
 rising was very natural. The teaching of the Church paints man as
 fallen and depraved. The new secular knowledge clashed at a thousand
 points, alike in letter and in spirit, with the old sacred lore. Even
 where it did not clash, its vitality of interest and attraction drove
 the older lore into neglected shade. To stir men's vivid curiosity and
 hope about the earth was to make their care much less absorbing about
 the kingdom of heaven. To awaken in them the spirit of social
 improvement was ruin to the most scandalous and crying social abuse
 then existing. The old spiritual power had lost its instinct, once so
 keen and effective, of wise direction. Instead of being the guide and
 corrector of the organs of the temporal power, it was the worst of
 their accomplices. The Encyclopædia was an informal, transitory, and
 provisional organisation of the new spiritual power. The school of
 which it was the great expounder achieved a supreme control over
 opinion by the only title to which control belongs: a more penetrating
 eye for social exigencies and for the means of satisfying them.</p>

 <p>Our veteran humorist told us long ago in his whimsical way that the
 importance of the Acts of the French Philosophes recorded in whole
 acres of typography is fast exhausting itself, that the famed
 Encyclopædical Tree has borne no fruit, and that Diderot the great has
 contracted into Diderot the easily measurable. The humoristic method
 is a potent instrument for working such contractions and expansions at
 will. The greatest of men are measurable enough, if you choose to set
 up a standard that is half transcendental and half cynical. A saner
 and more patient criticism measures the conspicuous figures of the
 past differently. It seeks their relations to the great forward
 movements of the world, and asks to what quarter of the heavens their
 faces were set, whether towards the east where the new light dawns, or
 towards the west after the old light has sunk irrevocably down. Above
 all, a saner criticism bids us remember that pioneers in the
 progressive way are rare, their lives rude and sorely tried, and their
 services to mankind beyond price. "Diderot is Diderot," wrote one
 greater than Carlyle: "a peculiar individuality; whoever holds him or
 his doings cheaply is a Philistine, and the name of them is legion.
 Men know neither from God, nor from Nature, nor from their fellows,
 how to receive with gratitude what is valuable beyond appraisement"
 (<i>Goethe</i>). An intense Philistinism underlay the great spiritual
 reaction that followed the Revolution, and not even such of its
 apostles as Wordsworth and Carlyle wholly escaped the taint.</p>

 <p>Forty years ago, when Carlyle wrote, it might really seem to a
 prejudiced observer as if the encyclopædic tree had borne no fruit.
 Even then, and even when the critic happened to be a devotee of the
 sterile transcendentalism then in vogue, one might have expected some
 recognition of the fact that the seed of all the great improvements
 bestowed on France by the Revolution, in spite of the woful evils
 which followed in its train, had been sown by the Encyclopædists. But
 now that the last vapours of the transcendental reaction are clearing
 away, we see that the movement initiated by the Encyclopædia is again
 in full progress. Materialistic solutions in the science of man,
 humanitarian ends in legislation, naturalism in art, active faith in
 the improvableness of institutions—all these are once more the marks
 of speculation and the guiding ideas of practical energy. The
 philosophical parenthesis is at an end. The interruption of eighty
 years counts for no more than the twinkling of an eye in the history
 of the transformation of the basis of thought. And the interruption
 has for the present come to a close. Europe again sees the old enemies
 face to face; the Church, and a Social Philosophy slowly labouring to
 build her foundations in positive science. It cannot be other than
 interesting to examine the aims, the instruments, and the degree of
 success of those who a century ago saw most comprehensively how
 profound and far-reaching a metamorphosis awaited the thought of the
 Western world. We shall do this most properly in connection with
 Diderot.</p>

 <p>Whether we accept or question Comte's strong description of Diderot
 as the greatest genius of the eighteenth century, it is at least
 undeniable that he was the one member of the great party of
 illumination with a real title to the name of thinker. Voltaire and
 Rousseau were the heads of two important schools, and each of them set
 deep and unmistakable marks both on the opinion and the events of the
 century. It would not be difficult to show that their influence was
 wider than that of the philosopher who discerned the inadequateness of
 both. But Rousseau was moved by passion and sentiment; Voltaire was
 only the master of a brilliant and penetrating rationalism. Diderot
 alone of this famous trio had in his mind the idea of scientific
 method; alone showed any feeling for a doctrine, and for large organic
 and constructive conceptions. He had the rare faculty of true
 philosophic meditation. Though immeasurably inferior both to Voltaire
 and Rousseau in gifts of literary expression, he was as far their
 superior in breadth and reality of artistic principle. He was the
 originator of a natural, realistic, and sympathetic school of literary
 criticism. He aspired to impose new forms upon the drama. Both in
 imaginative creation and in criticism, his work was a constant appeal
 from the artificial conventions of the classic schools to the
 actualities of common life. The same spirit united with the tendency
 of his philosophy to place him among the very few men who have been
 great and genuine observers of human nature and human existence. So
 singular and widely active a genius may well interest us, even apart
 from the important place that he holds in the history of literature
 and opinion.</p>

 <h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />
 YOUTH.</h2>

 <p>Denis Diderot was born at Langres in 1713, being thus a few months
 younger than Rousseau (1712), nearly twenty years younger than
 Voltaire (1694), nearly two years younger than Hume (1711), and eleven
 years older than Kant (1724). His stock was ancient and of good
 repute. The family had been engaged in the great local industry, the
 manufacture of cutlery, for no less than two centuries in direct line.
 Diderot liked to dwell on the historic prowess of his town, from the
 days of Julius Cæsar and the old Lingones and Sabinus, down to the
 time of the Great Monarch. With the taste of his generation for
 tracing moral qualities to a climatic source, he explained a certain
 vivacity and mobility in the people of his district by the great
 frequency and violence of its atmospheric changes from hot to cold,
 from calm to storm, from rain to sunshine. "Thus they learn from
 earliest infancy to turn to every wind. The man of Langres has a head
 on his shoulders like the weathercock at the top of the church spire.
 It is never fixed at one point; if it returns to the point it has
 left, it is not to stop there. With an amazing rapidity in their
 movements, their desires, their plans, their fancies, their ideas,
 they are cumbrous in speech. For myself, I belong to my country side."
 This was thoroughly true. He inherited all the versatility of his
 compatriots, all their swift impetuosity, and something of their want
 of dexterity in expression.</p>

 <p>His father was one of the bravest, most upright, most patient, most
 sensible of men. Diderot never ceased to regret that the old man's
 portrait had not been taken with his apron on, his spectacles pushed
 up, and a hand on the grinder's wheel. After his death, none of his
 neighbours could speak of him to his son without tears in their eyes.
 Diderot, wild and irregular as were his earlier days, had always a
 true affection for his father. "One of the sweetest moments of my
 life," he once said, "was more than thirty years ago, and I remember
 it as if it were yesterday, when my father saw me coming home from
 school, my arms laden with the prizes I had carried off, and my
 shoulders burdened with the wreaths they had given me, which were too
 big for my brow and had slipped over my head. As soon as he caught
 sight of me some way off, he threw down his work, hurried to the door
 to meet me, and fell a-weeping. It is a fine sight—a grave and
 sterling man melted to tears."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id=
 "FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class=
 "fnanchor">[1]</a> Of his mother we know less. He had a
 sister, who seems to have possessed the rough material of his own
 qualities. He describes her as "lively, active, cheerful, decided,
 prompt to take offence, slow to come round again, without much care
 for present or future, never willing to be imposed on by people or
 circumstance; free in her ways, still more free in her talk; she is a
 sort of Diogenes in petticoats.... She is the most original and the
 most strongly-marked creature I know; she is goodness itself, but with
 a peculiar physiognomy."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id=
 "FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
 His only brother showed some of the same native stuff, but of thinner
 and sourer quality. He became an abbé and a saint, peevish,
 umbrageous, and as excessively devout as his more famous brother was
 excessively the opposite. "He would have been a good friend and a good
 brother," wrote Diderot, "if religion had not bidden him trample under
 foot such poor weaknesses as these. He is a good Christian, who proves
 to me every minute of the day how much better it would be to be a good
 man. He shows that what they call evangelical perfection is only the
 mischievous art of stifling nature, which would most likely have
 spoken as lustily in him as in me."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id=
 "FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class=
 "fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

 <p>Diderot, like so many others of the eighteenth-century reformers,
 was a pupil of the Jesuits. An ardent, impetuous, over-genial
 temperament was the cause of frequent irregularities in conduct. But
 his quick and active understanding overcame all obstacles. His
 teachers, ever wisely on the alert for superior capacity, hoped to
 enlist his talents in the Order. Either they or he planned his escape
 from home, but his father got to hear of it. "My grandfather," says
 Diderot's daughter, "kept the profoundest silence, but as he went off
 to bed took with him the keys of the yard door." When he heard his son
 going downstairs, he presented himself before him, and asked whither
 he was bound at twelve o'clock at night. "To Paris," replied the
 youth, "where I am to join the Jesuits." "That will not be to-night;
 but your wishes shall be fulfilled. First let us have our sleep." The
 next morning his father took two places in the coach, and carried him
 to Paris to the Collége d'Harcourt. He made all the arrangements, and
 wished his son good-bye. But the good man loved the boy too dearly to
 leave him without being quite at ease how he would fare; he had the
 patience to remain a whole fortnight, killing the time and half dead
 of weariness in an inn, without ever seeing the one object of his
 stay. At the end of the fortnight he went to the college, and Diderot
 used many a time to say that such a mark of tenderness and goodness
 would have made him go to the other end of the world if his father had
 required it. "My friend," said his father, "I am come to see if you
 are well, if you are satisfied with your superiors, with your food,
 with your companions, and with yourself. If you are not well or not
 happy, we will go back together to your mother. If you had rather stay
 where you are, I am come to give you a word, to embrace you, and to
 leave you my blessing." The boy declared he was perfectly happy; and
 the principal pronounced him an excellent scholar, though already
 promising to be a troublesome one.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id=
 "FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class=
 "fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

 <p>After a couple of years the young Diderot, like other sons of Adam,
 had to think of earning his bread. The usual struggle followed between
 youthful genius and old prudence. His father, who was a man of
 substance, gave him his choice between medicine and law. Law he
 refused because he did not choose to spend his days in doing other
 people's business; and medicine, because he had no turn for killing.
 His father resolutely declined to let him have more money on these
 terms, and Diderot was thrown on his wits.</p>

 <p>The man of letters shortly before the middle of the century was as
 much an outcast and a beggar in Paris as he was in London. Voltaire,
 Gray, and Richardson were perhaps the only three conspicuous writers
 of the time, who had never known what it was to want a meal or to go
 without a shirt. But then none of the three depended on his pen for
 his livelihood. Every other man of that day whose writings have
 delighted and instructed the world since, had begun his career, and
 more than one of them continued and ended it, as a drudge and a
 vagabond. Fielding and Collins, Goldsmith and Johnson, in England;
 Goldoni in Italy; Vauvenargues, Marmontel, Rousseau, in France;
 Winckelmann and Lessing in Germany, had all alike been doubtful of
 dinner, and trembled about a night's lodging. They all knew the life
 of mean hazard, sorry shift, and petty expedient again and again
 renewed. It is sorrowful to think how many of the compositions of that
 time that do most to soothe and elevate some of the best hours of our
 lives, were written by men with aching hearts, in the midst of haggard
 perplexities. The man of letters, as distinguished alike from the
 old-fashioned scholar and the systematic thinker, now first became a
 distinctly marked type. Macaulay has contrasted the misery of the Grub
 Street hack of Johnson's time, with the honours accorded to men like
 Prior and Addison at an earlier date, and the solid sums paid by
 booksellers to the authors of our own day. But these brilliant
 passages hardly go lower than the surface of the great change. Its
 significance lay quite apart from the prices paid for books. The
 all-important fact about the men of letters in France was that they
 constituted a new order, that their rise signified the transfer of the
 spiritual power from ecclesiastical hands, and that, while they were
 the organs of a new function, they associated it with a new substitute
 for doctrine. These men were not only the pupils of the Jesuits; they
 were also their immediate successors as the teachers, the guides, and
 the directors of society. For two hundred years the followers of
 Ignatius had taken the intellectual and moral control of Catholic
 communities out of the failing hands of the Popes and the secular
 clergy. Their own hour had now struck. The rationalistic historian has
 seldom done justice to the services which this great Order rendered to
 European civilisation. The immorality of many of their maxims, their
 too frequent connivance at political wrong for the sake of power,
 their inflexible malice against opponents, and the cupidity and
 obstructiveness of the years of their decrepitude, have blinded us to
 the many meritorious pages of the Jesuit chronicle. Even men like
 Diderot and Voltaire, whose lives were for years made bitter by Jesuit
 machinations, gave many signs that they recognised the aid which had
 been rendered by their old masters to the cultivation and
 enlightenment of Europe. It was from the Jesuit fathers that the men
 of letters whom they trained, acquired that practical and social habit
 of mind which made the world and its daily interests so real to them.
 It was perhaps also his Jesuit preceptors whom the man of letters had
 to blame for a certain want of rigour and exactitude on the side of
 morality.</p>

 <p>What was this new order which thus struggled into existence, which
 so speedily made itself felt, and at length so completely succeeded in
 seizing the lapsed inheritance of the old spiritual organisation? Who
 is this man of letters? A satirist may easily describe him in epigrams
 of cheap irony; the pedant of the colleges may see in him a frivolous
 and shallow profaner of the mysteries of learning; the intellectual
 coxcomb who nurses his own dainty wits in critical sterility, despises
 him as Sir Piercie Shafton would have despised Lord Lindsay of the
 Byres. This notwithstanding, the man of letters has his work to do in
 the critical period of social transition. He is to be distinguished
 from the great systematic thinker, as well as from the great
 imaginative creator. He is borne on the wings neither of a broad
 philosophic conception nor of a lofty poetic conception. He is only
 the propagator of portions of such a conception, and of the minor
 ideas which they suggest. Unlike the Jesuit father whom he replaced,
 he has no organic doctrine, no historic tradition, no effective
 discipline, and no definite, comprehensive, far-reaching, concentrated
 aim. The characteristic of his activity is dispersiveness. Its
 distinction is to popularise such detached ideas as society is in a
 condition to assimilate; to interest men in these ideas by dressing
 them up in varied forms of the literary art; to guide men through them
 by judging, empirically and unconnectedly, each case of conduct, of
 policy, or of new opinion as it arises. We have no wish to exalt the
 office. On the contrary, I accept the maxim of that deep observer who
 warned us that "the mania for isolation is the plague of the human
 throng, and to be strong we must march together. You only obtain
 anything by developing the spirit of discipline among men."<a name=
 "FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class=
 "fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

 <p>But there are ages of criticism when discipline is impossible, and
 the evils of isolation are less than the evils of rash and premature
 organisation. Fontenelle was the first and in some respects the
 greatest type of this important class. He was sceptical, learned,
 ingenious, eloquent. He stretched hands (1657-1757) from the famous
 quarrel between Ancients and Moderns down to the Encyclopædia, and
 from Bossuet and Corneille down to Jean Jacques and Diderot. When he
 was born, the man of letters did not exist. When he died, the man of
 letters was the most conspicuous personage in France. But when Diderot
 first began to roam about the streets of Paris, this enormous change
 was not yet complete.</p>

 <p>For some ten years (1734-1744) Diderot's history is the old tale of
 hardship and chance; of fine constancy and excellent faith, not wholly
 free from an occasional stroke of rascality. For a time he earned a
 little money by teaching. If the pupil happened to be quick and
 docile, he grudged no labour, and was content with any fee or none. If
 the pupil happened to be dull, Diderot never came again, and preferred
 going supperless to bed. His employers paid him as they chose, in
 shirts, in a chair or a table, in books, in money, and sometimes they
 never paid him at all. The prodigious exuberance of his nature
 inspired him with a sovereign indifference to material details. From
 the beginning he belonged to those to whom it comes by nature to count
 life more than meat, and the body than raiment. The outward things of
 existence were to him really outward. They never vexed or absorbed his
 days and nights, nor overcame his vigorous constitutional instinct for
 the true proportions of external circumstance. He was of the humour of
 the old philosopher who, when he heard that all his worldly goods had
 been lost in a shipwreck, only made for answer, <i>Jubet me fortuna
 expeditius philosophari</i>. Once he had the good hap to be appointed
 tutor to the sons of a man of wealth. He performed his duties
 zealously, he was well housed and well fed, and he gave the fullest
 satisfaction to his employer. At the end of three months the
 mechanical toil had grown unbearable to him. The father of his pupils
 offered him any terms if he would remain. "Look at me, sir," replied
 the tutor; "my face is as yellow as a lemon. I am making men of your
 children, but each day I am becoming a child with them. I am a
 thousand times too rich and too comfortable in your house; leave it I
 must. What I want is not to live better, but to avoid dying." Again he
 plunged from comfort into the life of the garret. If he met any old
 friend from Langres, he borrowed, and the honest father repaid the
 loan. His mother's savings were brought to him by a faithful creature
 who had long served in their house, and who now more than once trudged
 all the way from home on this errand, and added her own humble
 earnings to the little stock. Many a time the hours went very slowly
 for the necessitous man. One Shrove Tuesday he rose in the morning,
 and found his pockets empty even of so much as a halfpenny. His
 friends had not invited him to join their squalid Bohemian revels.
 Hunger and thoughts of old Shrovetide merriment and feasting in the
 far-off home made work impossible. He hastened out of doors and walked
 about all day visiting such public sights as were open to the
 penniless. When he returned to his garret at night, his landlady found
 him in a swoon, and with the compassion of a good soul she forced him
 to share her supper. "That day," Diderot used to tell his children in
 later years, "I promised myself that if ever happier times should
 come, and ever I should have anything, I would never refuse help to
 any living creature, nor ever condemn him to the misery of such a day
 as that."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> And the real interest of the
 story lies in the fact that no oath was ever more faithfully kept.
 There is no greater test of the essential richness of a man's nature
 than that this squalid adversity, not of the sentimental introspective
 kind but hard and grinding, and not even kept in countenance by
 respectability, fails to make him a savage or a miser or a
 misanthrope.</p>

 <p>Diderot had his bitter moments. He knew the gloom and despondency
 that have their inevitable hour in every solitary and unordered life.
 But the fits did not last. They left no sour sediment, and this is the
 sign of health in temperament, provided it be not due to mere
 callousness. From that horrible quality Diderot assuredly was the
 furthest removed of any one of his time. Now and always he walked with
 a certain large carelessness of spirit. He measured life with a roving
 and liberal eye. Circumstance and conventions, the words under which
 men hide things, the oracles of common acceptance, the infinitely
 diversified properties of human character, the many complexities of
 our conduct and destiny—all these he watched playing freely around
 him, and he felt no haste to compress his experience into maxims and
 system. He was absolutely uncramped by any of the formal mannerisms of
 the spirit. He was wholly uncorrupted by the affectation of culture
 with which the great Goethe infected part of the world a generation
 later. His own life was never made the centre of the world.
 Self-development and self-idealisation as ends in themselves would
 have struck Diderot as effeminate drolleries. The daily and hourly
 interrogation of experience for the sake of building up the fabric of
 his own character in this wise or that, would have been
 incomprehensible and a little odious to him in theory, and impossible
 as a matter of practice. In the midst of all the hardships of his
 younger time, as afterwards in the midst of crushing Herculean
 taskwork, he was saved from moral ruin by the inexhaustible geniality
 and expansiveness of his affections. Nor did he narrow their play by
 looking only to the external forms of human relation. To Diderot it
 came easily to act on a principle which most of us only accept in
 words: he looked not to what people said, nor even to what they did,
 but wholly to what they were.</p>

 <p>Those whom he had once found reason to love and esteem might do him
 many an ill turn, without any fear of estranging him. Any one can
 measure character by conduct. It is a harder thing to be willing, in
 cases that touch our own interests, to interpret conduct by previous
 knowledge of character. His father, for instance, might easily have
 spared money enough to save him from the harassing privations of
 Bohemian life in Paris. A less full-blooded and generous person than
 Diderot would have resented the stoutness of the old man's
 persistency. Diderot on the contrary felt and delighted to feel, that
 this conflict of wills was a mere accident which left undisturbed the
 reality of old love. "The first few years of my life in Paris," he
 once told an acquaintance, "had been rather irregular; my behaviour
 was enough to irritate my father, without there being any need to make
 it worse by exaggeration. Still calumny was not wanting. People told
 him—well what did they not tell him? An opportunity for going to see
 him presented itself. I did not give it two thoughts. I set out full
 of confidence in his goodness. I thought that he would see me, that I
 should throw myself into his arms, that we should both of us shed
 tears, and that all would be forgotten. I thought rightly."<a name=
 "FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class=
 "fnanchor">[7]</a> We may be sure of a stoutness of native stuff in
 any stock where so much tenacity united with such fine confidence on
 one side, and such generous love on the other. It is a commonplace how
 much waste would be avoided in human life if men would more freely
 allow their vision to pierce in this way through the distorting veils
 of egoism, to the reality of sentiment and motive and
 relationship.</p>

 <p>Throughout his life Diderot was blessed with that divine gift of
 pity, which one that has it could hardly be willing to barter for the
 understanding of an Aristotle. Nor was it of the sentimental type
 proper for fine ladies. One of his friends had an aversion for women
 with child. "What monstrous sentiment!" Diderot wrote; "for my part,
 that condition has always touched me. I cannot see a woman of the
 common people so, without a tender commiseration."<a name=
 "FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class=
 "fnanchor">[8]</a> And Diderot had delicacy and respect in his pity.
 He tells a story in one of his letters of a poor woman who had
 suffered some wrong from a priest; she had not money enough to resort
 to law, until a friend of Diderot took her part. The suit was gained;
 but when the moment came for execution, the priest had vanished with
 all his goods. The woman came to thank her protector, and to regret
 the loss he had suffered. "As she chatted, she pulled a shabby
 snuff-box out of her pocket, and gathered up with the tip of her
 finger what little snuff remained at the bottom: her benefactor says
 to her 'Ah, ah! you have no more snuff; give me your box, and I will
 fill it.' He took the box and put into it a couple of louis, which he
 covered up with snuff. Now there's an action thoroughly to my taste,
 and to yours too! Give, but, if you can, spare to the poor the shame
 of holding out a hand."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id=
 "FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
 And the important thing, as we have said, is that Diderot was as good
 as his sentiment. Unlike most of the fine talkers of that day, to him
 these homely and considerate emotions were the most real part of life.
 Nobody in the world was ever more eager to give succour to others, nor
 more careless of his own ease.</p>

 <p>One singular story of Diderot's heedlessness about himself has
 often been told before, but we shall be none the worse in an egoistic
 world for hearing it told again. There came to him one morning a young
 man, bringing a manuscript in his hand. He begged Diderot to do him
 the favour of reading it, and to make any remarks he might think
 useful on the margin. Diderot found it to be a bitter satire upon his
 own person and writings. On the young man's return, Diderot asked him
 his grounds for making such an attack. "I am without bread," the
 satirist answered, "and I hoped you might perhaps give me a few crowns
 not to print it." Diderot at once forgot everything in pity for the
 starving scribbler. "I will tell you a way of making more than that by
 it. The brother of the Duke of Orleans is one of the pious, and he
 hates me. Dedicate your satire to him, get it bound with his arms on
 the cover; take it to him some fine morning, and you will certainly
 get assistance from him." "But I don't know the prince, and the
 dedicatory epistle embarrasses me." "Sit down," said Diderot, "and I
 will write one for you." The dedication was written, the author
 carried it to the prince, and received a handsome fee.<a name=
 "FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"
 class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

 <p>Marmontel assures us that never was Diderot seen to such advantage
 as when an author consulted him about a work. "You should have seen
 him," he says, "take hold of the subject, pierce to the bottom of it,
 and at a single glance discover of what riches and of what beauty it
 was susceptible. If he saw that the author missed the right track,
 instead of listening to the reading, he at once worked up in his head
 all that the author had left crude and imperfect. Was it a play, he
 threw new scenes into it, new incidents, new strokes of character; and
 thinking that he had actually heard all that he had dreamed, he
 extolled to the skies the work that had just been read to him, and in
 which, when it saw the light, we found hardly anything that he had
 quoted from it.... He who was one of the most enlightened men of the
 century, was also one of the most amiable; and in everything that
 touched moral goodness, when he spoke of it freely, I cannot express
 the charm of his eloquence. His whole soul was in his eyes and on his
 lips; never did a countenance better depict the goodness of the
 heart."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Morellet is equally loud
 in praise, not only of Diderot's conversation, its brilliance, its
 vivacity, its fertility, its suggestiveness, its sincerity, but also
 his facility and indulgence to all who sought him, and of the
 sympathetic readiness with which he gave the very best of himself to
 others.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

 <p>It is needless to say that such a temper was constantly abused.
 Three-fourths of Diderot's life were reckoned by his family to have
 been given up to people who had need of his purse, his knowledge, or
 his good offices. His daughter compares his library to a shop crowded
 by a succession of customers, but the customers took whatever wares
 they sought, not by purchase, but by way of free gift. Luckily for
 Diderot, he was thus generous by temperament, and not because he
 expected gratitude. Any necessitous knave with the gift of tears and
 the mask of sensibility could dupe and prey upon him. In one case he
 had taken a great deal of trouble for one of these needy and
 importunate clients; had given him money and advice, and had devoted
 much time to serve him. At the end of their last interview Diderot
 escorts his departing friend to the head of the staircase. The
 grateful client then asks him whether he knows natural history. "Well,
 not much," Diderot replies; "I know an aloe from a lettuce, and a
 pigeon from a humming-bird." "Do you know about the <i>Formica
 leo?</i> No? Well, it is a little insect that is wonderfully
 industrious; it hollows out in the ground a hole shaped like a funnel,
 it covers the surface with a light fine sand, it attracts other
 insects, it takes them, it sucks them dry, and then it says to them,
 'M. Diderot, I have the honour to wish you good day.'"<a name=
 "FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13"
 class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

 <p>Yet insolence and ingratitude made no difference to Diderot. His
 ear always remained as open to every tale of distress, his sensibility
 always as quickly touched, his time, money, and service always as
 profusely bestowed. I know not whether to say that this was made more,
 or that it was made less, of a virtue by his excess of tolerance for
 social castaways and reprobates. Our rough mode of branding a man as
 bad revolted him. The common appetite for constituting ourselves
 public prosecutors for the universe, was to him one of the worst of
 human weaknesses. "You know," he used to say, "all the impetuosity of
 the passions; you have weighed all circumstance in your everlasting
 balance; you pass sentence on the goodness or the badness of
 creatures; you set up rewards and penalties among matters which have
 no proportion nor relation with one another. Are you sure that you
 have never committed wrong acts, for which you pardoned yourselves
 because their object was so slight, though at bottom they implied more
 wickedness than a crime prompted by misery or fury? Even magistrates,
 supported by experience, by the law, by conventions which force them
 sometimes to give judgment against the testimony of their own
 conscience, still tremble as they pronounce the doom of the accused.
 And since when has it been lawful for the same person to be at once
 judge and informer?"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id=
 "FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class=
 "fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

 <p>Such reasoned leniency is the noblest of traits in a man. "I am
 more affected," he said, in words of which better men that Diderot
 might often be reminded, "by the charms of virtue than by the
 deformity of vice. I turn mildly away from the bad, and I fly to
 embrace the good. If there is in a work, in a character, in a
 painting, in a statue, a single fine bit, then on that my eyes fasten;
 I see only that: that is all I remember; the rest is as good as
 forgotten."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

 <p>This is the secret of a rare and admirable temperament. It carried
 Diderot well through the trial and ordeal of the ragged apprenticeship
 of letters. What to other men comes by culture, came to him by inborn
 force and natural capaciousness. We do not know in what way Diderot
 trained and nourished his understanding. The annotations to his
 translation of Shaftesbury, as well as his earliest original pieces,
 show that he had read Montaigne and Pascal, and not only read but
 meditated on them with an independent mind. They show also that he had
 been impressed by the Civitas Dei of Augustine, and had at least
 dipped into Terence and Horace, Cicero and Tacitus. His subsequent
 writings prove that, like the other men of letters of his day, he
 found in our own literature the chief external stimulant to thought.
 Above all, he was impressed by the magnificent ideas of the
 illustrious Bacon, and these ideas were the direct source of the great
 undertaking of Diderot's life. He is said to have read little and to
 have meditated much —the right process for the few men of his potent
 stamp. The work which he had to do for bread was of the kind that
 crushes anything short of the strongest faculty. He composed sermons.
 A missionary once ordered half-a-dozen of them for consumption in the
 Portuguese colonies, and paid him fifty crowns apiece, which Diderot
 counted far from the worst bargain of his life. All this was beggarly
 toil for a man of genius, but Diderot never took the trouble to think
 of himself as a man of genius, and was quite content with life as it
 came. If he found himself absolutely without food and without pence,
 he began moodily to think of abandoning his books and his pen, and of
 complying with the wishes of his father. A line of Homer, an idea from
 the Principia, an interesting problem in algebra or geometry, was
 enough to restore the eternally invincible spell of knowledge. And no
 sooner was this commanding interest touched, than the cloud of
 uncomfortable circumstance vanished from before the sun, and calm and
 serenity filled his spirit.</p>

 <p>Montesquieu used to declare that he had never known a chagrin which
 half an hour of a book was not able to dispel. Diderot had the same
 fortunate temper.</p>

 <p>Yet Diderot was not essentially a man of books. He never fell into
 the characteristic weakness of the follower of letters, by treating
 books as ends in themselves, or placing literature before life.
 Character, passion, circumstance, the real tragi-comedy, not its
 printed shadow and image, engrossed him. He was in this respect more
 of the temper of Rousseau, than he was like Voltaire or Fontenelle.
 "Abstraction made," he used to say, "of my existence and of the
 happiness of my fellows, what does the rest of nature matter to me?"
 Yet, as we see, nobody that ever lived was more interested in
 knowledge. His biographer and disciple remarked the contrast in him
 between his ardent impetuous disposition and enthusiasm, and his
 spirit of close unwearied observation. <i>Faire le bien, connaître le
 vrai</i>, was his formula for the perfect life, and defined the only
 distinction that he cared to recognise between one man and another.
 And the only motive he ever admitted as reasonable for seeking truth,
 was as a means of doing good. So strong was his sense of practical
 life, in the midst of incessant theorising.</p>
 <hr style='width: 45%;' />

 <p>At the moment when he had most difficulty in procuring a little
 bread each day for himself, Diderot conceived a violent passion for a
 seamstress, Antoinnette Champion by name, who happened to live in his
 neighbourhood. He instantly became importunate for marriage. The
 mother long protested with prudent vigour against a young man of such
 headstrong impetuosity, who did nothing and who had nothing, save the
 art of making speeches that turned her daughter's head. At length the
 young man's golden tongue won the mother as it had won the daughter.
 It was agreed that his wishes should be crowned, if he could procure
 the consent of his family. Diderot fared eagerly and with a sanguine
 heart to Langres. His father supposed that he had seen the evil of his
 ways, and was come at last to continue the honest tradition of their
 name. When the son disclosed the object of his visit, he was treated
 as a madman and threatened with malediction. Without a word of
 remonstrance he started back one day for Paris. Madame Champion warned
 him that his project must now be for ever at an end. Such unflinching
 resoluteness is often the last preliminary before surrender. Diderot
 fell ill. The two women could not bear to think of him lying sick in a
 room no better than a dog-kennel, without broths and tisanes, lonely
 and sorrowful. They hastened to nurse him, and when he got well, what
 he thought the great object of his life was reached. He and his adored
 were married (1743).<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id=
 "FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class=
 "fnanchor">[16]</a> As has been said, "Choice in marriage is a great
 match of cajolery between purpose and invisible hazard: deep criticism
 of a game of pure chance is time wasted." In Diderot's case destiny
 was hostile.</p>

 <p>His wife was over thirty. She was dutiful, sage, and pious. She had
 plenty of that devotion which in small things women so seldom lack.
 While her husband went to dine out, she remained at home to dine and
 sup on dry bread, and was pleased to think that the next day she would
 double the little ordinary for him. Coffee was too dear to be a
 household luxury, so every day she handed him a few halfpence to have
 his cup, and to watch the chess-players at the Café de la Régence.
 When after a year or two she went to make her peace with her
 father-in-law at Langres, she wound her way round the old man's heart
 by her affectionate caresses, her respect, her ready industry in the
 household, her piety, her simplicity. It is, however, unfortunately
 possible for even the best women to manifest their goodness, their
 prudence, their devotion, in forms that exasperate. Perhaps it was so
 here. Diderot at fifty was an orderly and steadfast person, but at
 thirty the blood of vagabondage was still hot within him. He needed in
 his companion a robust patience, to match his own too robust activity.
 One may suppose that if Mirabeau had married Hannah More, the union
 would have turned out ill, and Diderot's marriage was unluckily of
 such a type. His wife's narrow pieties and homely solicitudes fretted
 him. He had not learned to count the cost of deranging the fragile
 sympathy of the hearth. While his wife was away on her visit to his
 family, he formed a connection with a woman (Madame Puisieux) who
 seems to have been as bad and selfish as his wife was the opposite.
 She was the authoress of some literary pieces, which the world
 willingly and speedily let die; but even very moderate pretensions to
 <i>bel-esprit</i> may have seemed wonderfully refreshing to a man
 wearied to death by the illiterate stupidity of his daily
 companion.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> This lasted some three or
 four years down to 1749. As we shall see, he discovered the infidelity
 of his mistress and broke with her. But by this time his wife's
 virtues seem to have gone a little sour, as disregarded prudence and
 thwarted piety are so apt to do. It was too late now to knit up again
 the ravelled threads of domestic concord. During a second absence of
 his wife in Champagne (1754), he formed a new attachment to the
 daughter of a financier's widow (Mdlle. Voland). This lasted to the
 end of the lady's days (1783 or 1784).</p>

 <p>There is probably nothing very profitable to be said about all this
 domestic disorder. We do not know enough of the circumstances to be
 sure of allotting censure in exact and rightful measure. We have to
 remember that such irregularities were in the manners of the time. To
 connect them by way of effect with the new opinions in religion, would
 be as impertinent as to trace the immoralities of Dubois or Lewis the
 Fifteenth or the Cardinal de Rohan to the old opinions.</p>

 EARLY WRITINGS.</h2>

 <p>La Rochefoucauld, expressing a commonplace with the penetrative
 terseness that made him a master of the apophthegm, pronounced it "not
 to be enough to have great qualities: a man must have the economy of
 them." Or, as another writer says: "Empire in this world belongs not
 so much to wits, to talents, and to industry, as to a certain skilful
 economy and to the continual management that a man has the art of
 applying to all his other gifts."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id=
 "FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class=
 "fnanchor">[18]</a> Notwithstanding the peril that haunts superlative
 propositions, we are inclined to say that Diderot is the most striking
 illustration of this that the history of letters or speculation has to
 furnish. If there are many who have missed the mark which they or
 kindly intimates thought them certain of attaining, this is mostly not
 for want of economy, but for want of the great qualities which were
 imputed to them by mistake. To be mediocre, to be sterile, to be
 futile, are the three fatal endings of many superbly announced
 potentialities. Such an end nearly always comes of exaggerated
 faculty, rather than of bad administration of natural gifts. In
 Diderot were splendid talents. It was the art of prudent stewardship
 that lay beyond his reach. Hence this singular fact, that he perhaps
 alone in literature has left a name of almost the first eminence, and
 impressed his greatness upon men of the strongest and most different
 intelligence, and yet never produced a masterpiece; many a fine page,
 as Marmontel said, but no one fine work.</p>

 <p>No man that ever wrote was more wholly free from that unquiet
 self-consciousness which too often makes literary genius pitiful or
 odious in the flesh. He put on no airs of pretended resignation to
 inferior production, with bursting hints of the vast superiorities
 that unfriendly circumstance locked up within him. Yet on one
 occasion, and only on one, so far as evidence remains, he indulged a
 natural regret. "And so," he wrote when revising the last sheets of
 the Encyclopædia (July 25, 1765), "in eight or ten days I shall see
 the end of an undertaking that has occupied me for twenty years; that
 has not made my fortune by a long way; that has exposed me many a time
 to the risk of having to quit my country or lose my freedom; and that
 has consumed a life that I might have made both more useful and more
 glorious. The sacrifice of talent to need would be less common, if it
 were only a question of self. One could easily resolve rather to drink
 water and eat dry crusts and follow the bidding of one's genius in a
 garret. But for a woman and for children, what can one not resolve? If
 I sought to make myself of some account in their eyes, I would not
 say—I have worked thirty years for you: I would say—I have for you
 renounced for thirty years the vocation of my nature; I have preferred
 to renounce my tastes in doing what was useful for you, instead of
 what was agreeable to myself. That is your real obligation to me, and
 of that you never think."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id=
 "FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class=
 "fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

 <p>It is a question, nevertheless, whether Diderot would have achieved
 masterpieces, even if the pressure of housekeeping had never driven
 him to seek bread where he could find it. Indeed it is hardly a
 question. His genius was spacious and original, but it was too
 dispersive, too facile of diversion, too little disciplined, for the
 prolonged effort of combination which is indispensable to the greater
 constructions whether of philosophy or art. The excellent talent of
 economy and administration had been denied him; that thrift of
 faculty, which accumulates store and force for concentrated occasions.
 He was not encyclopædic by accident, nor merely from external
 necessity. The quality of rapid movement, impetuous fancy, versatile
 idea, which he traced to the climate of his birthplace, marked him
 from the first for an encyclopædic or some such task. His interest was
 nearly as promptly and vehemently kindled in one subject as in
 another; he was always boldly tentative, always fresh and vigorous in
 suggestion, always instant in search. But this multiplicity of active
 excitements—and with Diderot every interest rose to the warmth of
 excitement—was even more hostile to masterpieces than were the
 exigencies of a livelihood. It was not unpardonable in a moment of
 exhaustion and chagrin to fancy that he had offered up the treasures
 of his genius to the dull gods of the hearth. But if he had been
 childless and unwedded, the result would have been the same. He is the
 munificent prodigal of letters, always believing his substance
 inexhaustible, never placing a limit to his fancies nor a bound to his
 outlay. "It is not they who rob me of my life," he wrote; "it is I who
 give it to them. And what can I do better than accord a portion of it
 to him who esteems me enough to solicit such a gift? I shall get no
 praise for it, 'tis true, either now while I am here, nor when I shall
 exist no longer; but I shall esteem myself for it, and people will
 love me all the better for it. 'Tis no bad exchange, that of
 benevolence, against a celebrity that one does not always win, and
 that nobody wins without a drawback. I have never once regretted the
 time that I have given to others; I can scarcely say as much for; the
 time that I have used for myself."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id=
 "FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class=
 "fnanchor">[20]</a> Remembering how uniformly men of letters take
 themselves somewhat too seriously, we may be sorry that this unique
 figure among them, who was in other respects constituted to be so
 considerable and so effective, did not take himself seriously
 enough.</p>

 <p>Apart from his moral inaptitude for the monumental achievements of
 authorship, Diderot was endowed with the gifts of the talker rather
 than with those of the writer. Like Dr. Johnson, he was a great
 converser rather than the author of great books. If we turn to his
 writings, we are at some loss to understand the secret of his
 reputation. They are too often declamatory, ill-compacted, broken by
 frequent apostrophes, ungainly, dislocated, and rambling. He has been
 described by a consummate judge as the most German of all the French.
 And his style is deeply marked by that want of feeling for the
 exquisite, that dulness of edge, that bluntness of stroke, which is
 the common note of all German literature, save a little of the very
 highest. In conversation we do not insist on constant precision of
 phrase, nor on elaborate sustension of argument. Apostrophe is made
 natural by the semi-dramatic quality of the situation. Even vehement
 hyperbole, which is nearly always a disfigurement in written prose,
 may become impressive or delightful, when it harmonises with the
 voice, the glance, the gesture of a fervid and exuberant converser.
 Hence Diderot's personality invested his talk, as happened in the case
 of Johnson and of Coleridge, with an imposing interest and a power of
 inspiration which we should never comprehend from the mere perusal of
 his writings.</p>

 <p>His admirers declared his head to be the ideal head of an Aristotle
 or a Plato. His brow was wide, lofty, open, gently rounded. The arch
 of the eyebrow was full of delicacy; the nose of masculine beauty; the
 habitual expression of the eyes kindly and sympathetic, but as he grew
 heated in talk, they sparkled like fire; the curves of the mouth
 bespoke an interesting mixture of finesse, grace, and geniality. His
 bearing was nonchalant enough, but there was naturally in the carriage
 of his head, especially when he talked with action, much dignity,
 energy, and nobleness. It seemed as if enthusiasm were the natural
 condition for his voice, for his spirit, for every feature. He was
 only truly Diderot when his thoughts had transported him beyond
 himself. His ideas were stronger than himself; they swept him along
 without the power either to stay or to guide their movement. "When I
 recall Diderot," wrote one of his friends, "the immense variety of his
 ideas, the amazing multiplicity of his knowledge, the rapid flight,
 the warmth, the impetuous tumult of his imagination, all the charm and
 all the disorder of his conversation, I venture to liken his character
 to nature herself, exactly as he used to conceive her—rich, fertile,
 abounding in germs of every sort, gentle and fierce, simple and
 majestic, worthy and sublime, but without any dominating principle,
 without a master and without a God."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id=
 "FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class=
 "fnanchor">[21]</a> Grétry, the musical composer, declares that
 Diderot was one of the rare men who had the art of blowing the spark
 of genius into flame; the first impulses stirred by his glowing
 imagination were of inspiration divine.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id=
 "FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class=
 "fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

 <p>Marmontel warns us that he who only knows Diderot in his writings,
 does not know him at all. We should have listened to his persuasive
 eloquence, and seen his face aglow with the fire of enthusiasm. It was
 when he grew animated in talk, and let all the abundance of his ideas
 flow freely from the source, that he became truly ravishing. In his
 writings, says Marmontel with obvious truth, he never had the art of
 forming a whole, and this was because that first process of arranging
 everything in its place was too slow and too tiresome for him. The
 want of ensemble vanished in the free and varied course of
 conversation.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

 <p>We have to remember then that Diderot was in this respect of the
 Socratic type, though he was unlike Socrates, in being the
 disseminator of positive and constructive ideas. His personality
 exerted a decisive force and influence. In reading the testimony of
 his friends, we think of the young Aristides saying to Socrates: "I
 always made progress whenever I was in your neighbourhood, even if I
 were only in the same house, without being in the same room; but my
 advancement was greater if I were in the same room with you, and
 greater still if I could keep my eyes fixed upon you."<a name=
 "FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24"
 class="fnanchor">[24]</a> It has been well said that Diderot, like
 Socrates, had about him a something dæmonic. He was possessed, and so
 had the first secret of possessing others. But then to reach
 excellence in literature, one must also have self-possession; a double
 current of impulse and deliberation; a free stream of ideas
 spontaneously obeying a sense or order, harmony, and form. Eloquence
 in the informal discourse of the parlour or the country walk did not
 mean in Diderot's case the empty fluency and nugatory emphasis of the
 ordinary talker of reputation. It must have been both pregnant and
 copious; declamatory in form, but fresh and substantial in matter;
 excursive in arrangement, but forcible and pointed in intention. No
 doubt, if he was a sage, he was sometimes a sage in a frenzy. He would
 wind up a peroration by dashing his nightcap passionately against the
 wall, by way of clencher to the argument. Yet this impetuosity, this
 turn for declamation, did not hinder his talk from being directly
 instructive. Younger men of the most various type, from Morellet down
 to Joubert, men quite competent to detect mere bombast or ardent
 vagueness, were held captive by the cogency of his understanding. His
 writings have none of this compulsion. We see the flame, but through a
 veil of interfused smoke. The expression is not obscure, but it is
 awkward; not exactly prolix, but heavy, overcharged, and opaque. We
 miss the vivid precision and the high spirits of Voltaire, the glow
 and the brooding sonorousness of Rousseau, the pomp of Buffon. To
 Diderot we go not for charm of style, but for a store of fertile
 ideas, for some striking studies of human life, and for a vigorous and
 singular personality.</p>

 <p>Diderot's knowledge of our language now did him good service. One
 of the details of the method by which he taught himself English is
 curious. Instead of using an Anglo-French dictionary, he always used
 one in Anglo-Latin. The sense of a Latin or Greek word, he said, is
 better established, more surely fixed, more definite, less liable to
 capricious peculiarities of convention, than the vernacular words
 which the whim or ignorance of the lexicographer may choose. The
 reader composes his own vocabulary, and gains both correctness and
 energy.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> However this may be, his
 knowledge of English was more accurate than is possessed by most
 French writers of our own day. Diderot's first work for the
 booksellers after his marriage seems to have been a translation in
 three volumes of Stanyan's History of Greece. For this, to the
 amazement of his wife, he got a hundred crowns. About the same time
 (1745) he published Principles of Moral Philosophy, or an Essay of Mr.
 S. on Merit and Virtue. The initial stands for Shaftesbury, and the
 book translated was his Inquiry concerning Virtue and Merit.</p>

 <p>Towards the same time, again, Diderot probably made acquaintance
 with Madame de Puisieux, of whom it has been said with too patent
 humour that she was without either the virtue or the merit on which
 her admirer had just been declaiming. We are told that it was her need
 of money which inspired him with his first original work. As his
 daughter's memoir, from which the tale comes, is swarming with
 blunders, this may not be more true than some of her other statements.
 All that we know of Diderot's sense and sincerity entitles him to the
 benefit of the doubt. The Philosophical Thoughts (1746) are a
 continuation of the vein of the annotations on the Essay. He is said
 to have thrown these reflections together between Good Friday and
 Easter Sunday. Nor is there anything incredible in such rapid
 production, when we remember the sweeping impetuosity with which he
 flung himself into all that he undertook. The Thoughts are evidently
 the fruits of long meditation, and the literary arrangement of them
 may well have been an easy task. They are a robuster development of
 the scepticism which was the less important side of Shaftesbury. The
 parliament of Paris ordered the book to be burnt along with some
 others (July 7, 1746), partly because they were heterodox, partly
 because the practice of publishing books without official leave was
 gaining an unprecedented height of license.<a name="FNanchor_26_26"
 id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class=
 "fnanchor">[26]</a> This was Diderot's first experience of that hand
 of authority, which was for thirty years to surround him with
 mortification and torment. But the disapproval of authority did not
 check the circulation or influence of the Thoughts. They were
 translated into German and Italian, and were honoured by a shower of
 hostile criticism. In France they were often reprinted, and even in
 our own day they are said not wholly to have lost their vogue as a
 short manual of scepticism.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id=
 "FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class=
 "fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

 <p>The historians of literature too often write as if a book were the
 cause or the controlling force of controversies in which it is really
 only a symbol, or a proclamation of feelings already in men's minds.
 We should never occupy ourselves in tracing the thread of a set of
 opinions, without trying to recognise the movement of living men and
 concrete circumstance that accompanied and caused the progress of
 thought. In watching how the beacon-fire flamed from height to
 height—</p>

 <div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
   <span>φάος δε τηέπομπον ουκ ηναίνετο<br /></span> <span>φρορα,
   προσαιθρίζουσα πόμπιμονφλόγα—<br /></span>
  </div>
 </div>

 <p>we should not forget that its source and reference lie in action,
 in the motion and stirring of confused hosts and multitudes of men. A
 book, after all, is only the mouthpiece of its author, and the author
 being human is moved and drawn by the events that occur under his eye.
 It was not merely because Bacon and Hobbes and Locke had written
 certain books, that Voltaire and Diderot became free-thinkers and
 assailed the church. "So long," it has been said, "as a Bossuet, a
 Fénelon, an Arnauld, a Nicole, were alive, Bayle made few proselytes;
 the elevation of Dubois and its consequences multiplied unbelievers
 and indifferents."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id=
 "FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class=
 "fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

 <p>The force of speculative literature always hangs on practical
 opportuneness. The economic evils of monasticism, the increasing
 flagrancy and grossness of superstition, the aggressive factiousness
 of the ecclesiastics, the cruelty of bigoted tribunals—these things
 disgusted and wearied the more enlightened spirits, and the English
 philosophy only held out an inspiring intellectual
 alternative.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

 <p>Nor was it accident that drew Diderot's attention to Shaftesbury,
 rather than to any other of our writers. That author's essay on
 Enthusiasm had been suggested by the extravagances of the French
 prophets, poor fanatics from the Cevennes, who had fled to London
 after the revocation of the edict of Nantes, and whose paroxysms of
 religious hysteria at length brought them into trouble with the
 authorities (1707). Paris saw an outbreak of the same kind of ecstasy,
 though on a much more formidable scale, among the Jansenist fanatics,
 from 1727 down to 1758, or later. Some of the best attested miracles
 in the whole history of the supernatural were wrought at the tomb of
 the Jansenist deacon, Paris.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id=
 "FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class=
 "fnanchor">[30]</a> The works of faith exalted multitudes into
 convulsive transports; men and women underwent the most cruel
 tortures, in the hope of securing a descent upon them of the divine
 grace. The sober citizen, whose journal is so useful a guide to
 domestic events in France from the Regency to the Peace of 1763, tells
 us the effect of this hideous revival upon public sentiment. People
 began to see, he says, what they were to think of the miracles of
 antiquity. The more they went into these matters, whether miracles or
 prophecies, the more obscurity they discovered in the one, the more
 doubt about the other. Who could tell that they had not been
 accredited and established in remote times with as little foundation
 as what was then passing under men's very eyes? Just in the same way,
 the violent and prolonged debates, the intrigue, the tergiversation,
 which attended the acceptance of the famous Bull Unigenitus, taught
 shrewd observers how it is that religions establish themselves. They
 also taught how little respect is due in our minds and consciences to
 the great points which the universal church claims to have
 decided.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

 <p>These are the circumstances which explain the rude and vigorous
 scepticism of Diderot's first performances. And they explain the
 influence of Shaftesbury over him. Neither Diderot nor his
 contemporaries were ready at once to plunge into the broader and
 firmer negation to which they afterwards committed themselves. No
 doubt some of the politeness which he shows to Christianity, both in
 the notes to his translation of Shaftesbury, and in his own
 Philosophic Thoughts, is no more than an ironical deference to
 established prejudices. The notes to the Essay on Merit and Virtue
 show that Diderot, like all the other French revolters against
 established prejudice, had been deeply influenced by the shrewd-witted
 Montaigne. But the ardour of the disciple pressed objections home with
 a trenchancy that is very unlike the sage distillations of the master.
 It was from Shaftesbury, however, that he borrowed common sense as a
 philosophic principle. Shaftesbury had indirectly drawn it from Locke,
 and through Hutcheson it became the source and sponsor of the Scottish
 philosophy of that century. This was a weapon exactly adapted for
 dealing with a theology that was discredited in the eyes of all cool
 observers by the hysterical extravagances of one set of religionists,
 and the factious pretensions of their rivals. And no other weapon was
 at hand. The historic or critical method of investigation was
 impossible, for the age did not possess the requisite learning. The
 indirect attack from the side of physical science was equally
 impossible. The bearing of Newton's great discovery on the current
 conceptions of the Creator and the supposed system of the divine
 government, was not yet fully realised. The other scientific ideas
 which have since made the old hypothesis less credible, were not at
 that time even conceived.</p>

 <p>Diderot did indeed perceive even so early as this that the
 controversy was passing from the metaphysicians to the physicists.
 Though he for the moment misinterpreted the ultimate direction of the
 effect of experimental discovery, he discerned its potency in the
 field of theological discussion. "It is not from the hands of the
 metaphysician," he said, "that atheism has received the weightiest
 strokes. The sublime meditations of Malebranche and Descartes were
 less calculated to shake materialism than a single observation of
 Malpighi's. If this dangerous hypothesis is tottering in our days, it
 is to experimental physics that such a result is due. It is only in
 the works of Newton, of Muschenbroek, of Hartzoeker, and of
 Nieuwentit, that people have found satisfactory proofs of the
 existence of a being of sovereign intelligence. Thanks to the works of
 these great men, the world is no longer a god; it is a machine with
 its cords, its pulleys, its springs, its weights."<a name=
 "FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32"
 class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In other words, Diderot had as yet not made
 his way beyond the halting-place which has been the favourite goal of
 English physicists from Newton down to Faraday.<a name=
 "FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33"
 class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Consistent materialism had not yet
 established itself in his mind. Meanwhile he laid about him with his
 common sense, just as Voltaire did, though Diderot has more
 weightiness of manner. If his use of the weapon cannot be regarded as
 a decisive settlement of the true issues, we have to remember that he
 himself became aware in a very short time of its inadequateness, and
 proceeded to the discussion, as we shall presently see, from another
 side.</p>

 <p>The scope of the Philosophical Thoughts, and the attitude of
 Diderot's mind when they were written, may be shown in a few brief
 passages. The opening words point to the significance of the new time
 in one direction, and they are the key-note to Diderot's whole
 character. "People are for ever declaiming against the passions; they
 set down to them all the pains that man endures, and quite forget that
 they are also the source of all his pleasures. It is regarded as an
 affront to reason if one dares to say a word in favour of its rivals.
 Yet it is only passions, and strong passions, that can raise the soul
 to great things. Sober passions produce only the commonplace. Deadened
 passions degrade men of extraordinary quality. Constraint annihilates
 the greatness and energy of nature. See that tree; 'tis to the luxury
 of its branches that you owe the freshness and the wide-spreading
 breadth of its shade, which you may enjoy till winter comes to despoil
 it of its leafy tresses. An end to all excellence in poetry, in
 painting, in music, as soon as superstition has once wrought upon
 human temperament the effect of old age! It is the very climax of
 madness to propose to oneself the ruin of the passions. A fine design
 truly in your pietist, to torment himself like a convict in order to
 desire nothing, love nothing, feel nothing; and he would end by
 becoming a true monster, if he were to succeed!"<a name=
 "FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34"
 class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Many years afterwards he wrote in the same
 sense to Madame Voland. "I have ever been the apologist of strong
 passions; they alone move me. Whether they inspire me with admiration
 or horror, I feel vehemently. If atrocious deeds that dishonour our
 nature are due to them, it is by them also that we are borne to the
 marvellous endeavour that elevates it. The man of mediocre passion
 lives and dies like the brute." And so forth, until the writer is
 carried to the perplexing position that "if we were bound to choose
 between Racine, a bad husband, a bad father, a false friend, and a
 sublime poet, and Racine, good father, good husband, good friend, and
 dull worthy man, I hold to the first. Of Racine, the bad man, what
 remains? Nothing. Of Racine, the man of genius? The work is
 eternal."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Without attempting to
 solve this problem in casuistry, we recognise Diderot's mood, and the
 hatred with which it would be sure to inspire him for the starved and
 mutilated passions of the Christian type. The humility, chastity,
 obedience, indolent solitude, which had for centuries been glorified
 by the Church, were monstrous to this vehement and energetic spirit.
 The church had placed heroism in effacement. Diderot, borne to the
 other extreme, left out even discipline. To turn from his maxims on
 the foundation of conduct, to his maxims on opinion. As we have said,
 his attitude is that of the sceptic:—</p>

 <p>What has never been put in question, has not been proved. What
 people have not examined without prepossessions, they have not
 examined thoroughly. Scepticism is the touchstone. (§ 31.)</p>

 <p>Incredulity is sometimes the vice of a fool, and credulity the
 defect of a man of intelligence. The latter sees far into the
 immensity of the Possible; the former scarcely sees anything possible
 beyond the Actual. Perhaps this is what produces the timidity of the
 one, and the temerity of the other.</p>

 <p>A demi-scepticism is the mark of a feeble understanding. It reveals
 a pusillanimous reasoner, who suffers himself to be alarmed by
 consequences; a superstitious creature, who thinks he is honouring God
 by the fetters which he imposes on his reason; a kind of unbeliever
 who is afraid of unmasking himself to himself. For if truth has
 nothing to lose by examination, as is the demi-sceptic's conviction,
 what does he think in the bottom of his heart of those privileged
 notions which he fears to sound, and which are placed in one of the
 recesses of his brain, as in a sanctuary to which he dares not draw
 nigh? (§ 34.)</p>

 <p>Scepticism does not suit everybody. It supposes profound and
 impartial examination. He who doubts because he does not know the
 grounds of credibility, is no better than an ignoramus. The true
 sceptic has counted and weighed the reasons. But it is no light matter
 to weigh arguments. Who of us knows their value with any nicety? Every
 mind has its own telescope. An objection that disappears in your eyes,
 is a colossus in mine: you find an argument trivial that to me is
 overwhelming.... If then it is so difficult to weigh reasons, and if
 there are no questions which have not two sides, and nearly always in
 equal measure, how come we to decide with such rapidity? (§ 24.)</p>

 <p>When the pious cry out against scepticism, it seems to me that they
 do not understand their own interest, or else that they are
 inconsistent. If it is certain that a true faith to be embraced, and a
 false faith to be abandoned, need only to be thoroughly known, then
 surely it must be highly desirable that universal doubt should spread
 over the surface of the earth, and that all nations should consent to
 have the truth of their religions examined. Our missionaries would
 find a good half of their work done for them. (§ 36.)</p>

 <p>One thing to be remembered is that Diderot, like Vauvenargues,
 Voltaire, Condorcet, always had Pascal in his mind when dealing with
 apologetics. They all recognised in him a thinker with a love of
 truth, as distinguished from the mere priest, Catholic, Anglican,
 Brahman, or another. "Pascal," says Diderot, "was upright, but he was
 timid and inclined to credulity. An elegant writer and a profound
 reasoner, he would doubtless have enlightened the world, if Providence
 had not abandoned him to people who sacrificed his talents to their
 own antipathies. How much to be regretted, that he did not leave to
 the theologians of his time the task of settling their own
 differences; that he did not give himself up to the search for truth,
 without reserve and without the fear of offending God by using all the
 intelligence that God had given him. How much to be regretted that he
 took for masters men who were not worthy to be his disciples, and was
 foolish enough to think Arnauld, De Sacy, and Nicole, better men than
 himself." (§ 14.) The Philosophic Thoughts are designed for an answer
 in form to the more famous Thoughts of this champion of popular
 theology. The first of the following extracts, for instance, recalls a
 memorable illustration of Pascal's sublime pessimism. A few passages
 will illustrate sufficiently the line of argument which led the
 foremost men at the opening of the philosophic revolution to reject
 the pretensions of Christianity:—</p>

 <p>What voices! what cries! what groans! Who is it that has shut up in
 dungeons all these piteous souls? What crimes have the poor wretches
 committed? Who condemns them to such torments? <i>The God whom they
 have offended</i>. Who then is this God? <i>A God full of
 goodness</i>. But would a God full of goodness take delight in bathing
 himself in tears? If criminals had to calm the furies of a tyrant,
 what would they do more?... There are people of whom we ought not to
 say that they fear God, but that they are horribly afraid of him....
 Judging from the picture they paint of the Supreme Being, from his
 wrath, from the rigour of his vengeance, from certain comparisons
 expressive of the ratio between those whom he leaves to perish and
 those to whom he deigns to stretch out a hand, the most upright soul
 would be tempted to wish that such a being did not exist. (§§
 7-9.)</p>

 <p>You present to an unbeliever a volume of writings of which you
 claim to show him the divinity. But, before going into your proofs, he
 will be sure to put some questions about your collection. Has it
 always been the same? Why is it less ample now than it was some
 centuries ago? By what right have they banished this work or that,
 which another sect reveres, and preserved this or that, which the
 other has repudiated?... You only answer all these difficulties by the
 avowal that the first foundations of the faith are purely human; that
 the choice between the manuscripts, the restoration of passages,
 finally the collection, has been made according to rules of criticism.
 Well, I do not refuse to concede to the divinity of the sacred books a
 degree of faith proportioned to the certainty of these rules. (§
 59.)</p>

 <p>People agree that it is of the last importance to employ none but
 solid arguments for the defence of a creed. Yet they would gladly
 persecute those who attempt to cry down the bad arguments. What then,
 is it not enough to be a Christian? Am I also to be one upon wrong
 grounds? (§57.)</p>

 <p>The less probability a fact has, the more does the testimony of
 history lose its weight. I should have no difficulty in believing a
 single honest man who should tell me that the king had just won a
 complete victory over the allies. But if all Paris were to assure me
 that a dead man had come to life again, I should not believe a word of
 it. That a historian should impose upon us, or that a whole people
 should be mistaken—there is no miracle in that. (§46.)</p>

 <p>What is God? A question that we put to children, and that
 philosophers have much trouble to answer. We know the age at which a
 child ought to learn to read, to sing, to dance, to begin Latin or
 geometry. It is only in religion that you take no account of his
 capacity. He scarcely hears what you say, before he is asked, What is
 God? It is at the same instant, from the same lips, that he learns
 that there are ghosts, goblins, were-wolves—and a God. (§25.)</p>

 <p>The diversity of religious opinions has led the deists to invent an
 argument that is perhaps more singular than sound. Cicero, having to
 prove that the Romans were the most warlike people in the world,
 adroitly draws this conclusion from the lips of their rivals. Gauls,
 to whom if to any, do you yield the palm for courage? To the Romans.
 Parthians, after you, who are the bravest of men? The Romans.
 Africans, whom would you fear, if you were to fear any? The Romans.
 Let us interrogate the religionists in this fashion, say the deists.
 Chinese, what religion would be the best, if your own were not the
 best? Naturalism. Mussulmans, what faith would you embrace, if you
 abjured Mahomet? Naturalism. Christians, what is the true religion, if
 it be not Christianity? Judaism. But you, O Jews, what is the true
 religion, if Judaism be false? Naturalism. Now those, continues
 Cicero, to whom the second place is awarded by unanimous consent, and
 who do not in turn concede the first place to any—it is those who
 incontestably deserve that place. (§62.)</p>
 <hr style='width: 45%;' />

 <p>In all this we notice one constant characteristic of the eighteenth
 century controversy about revealed religion. The assailant demands of
 the defender an answer to all the intellectual or logical objections
 that could possibly be raised by one who had never been a Christian,
 and who refused to become a Christian until these objections could be
 met. No account is taken of the mental conditions by which a creed is
 engendered and limited; nor of the train of historic circumstance
 which prepares men to receive it. The modern apologist escapes by
 explaining religion; the apologist of a hundred years ago was required
 to prove it. The end of such a method was inevitably a negation. The
 objective propositions of a creed with supernatural pretensions can
 never be demonstrated from natural or rationalistic premisses. And if
 they could be so demonstrated, it would only be on grounds that are
 equally good for some other creeds with the same pretensions. The
 sceptic was left triumphantly weighing one revealed system against
 another in an equal balance.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id=
 "FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class=
 "fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

 <p>The position of the writer of the Philosophical Thoughts is
 distinctly theistic. Yet there is at least one striking passage to
 show how forcibly some of the arguments on the other side impressed
 him. "I open," says Diderot, "the pages of a celebrated professor, and
 I read—'Atheists, I concede to you that movement is essential to
 matter; what conclusion do you draw from that? That the world results
 from the fortuitous concourse of atoms? You might as well say that
 Homer's Iliad, or Voltaire's Henriade, is a result of the fortuitous
 concourse of written characters.' Now for my part, I should be very
 sorry to use that reasoning to an atheist; the comparison would give
 him a very easy game to play. According to the laws of the analysis of
 chances, he would say to me, I ought not to be surprised that a thing
 comes to pass when it is possible, and the difficulty of the event is
 compensated by the number of throws. There is a certain number of
 throws in which I would safely back myself to bring 100,000 sixes at
 once with 100,000 dice. Whatever the definite number of the letters
 with which I am invited fortuitously to produce the Iliad, there is a
 certain definite number of throws which would make the proposal
 advantageous for me; nay, my advantage would be infinite if the
 quantity of throws accorded to me were infinite. Now, you grant to me
 that matter exists from all eternity, and that movement is essential
 to it. In return for this concession, I will suppose with you that the
 world has no limits; that the multitude of atoms is infinite, and that
 this order, which astonishes you, nowhere contradicts itself. Well,
 from these reciprocal admissions there follows nothing else unless it
 be this, that the possibility of engendering the universe fortuitously
 is very small, but that the number of throws is infinite, or in other
 words, that <i>the difficulty of the event is more than sufficiently
 compensated by the multitude of the throws. Therefore, if anything
 ought to be repugnant to reason, it is the supposition that,—matter
 being in motion from all eternity, and there being perhaps in the
 infinite number of possible combinations an infinite number of
 admirable arrangements,—none of these admirable arrangements would
 have been met with, out of the infinite multitude of all those which
 matter successively took on. Therefore the mind ought to be more
 astonished at the hypothetical duration of chaos."</i><a name=
 "FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37"
 class="fnanchor">[37]</a> (§ 21.)</p>

 <p>In a short continuation of the Philosophical Thoughts entitled On
 the Sufficiency of Natural Religion, Diderot took the next step, and
 turned towards that faith which the votaries of each creed allow to be
 the best after their own. Even here he is still in the atmosphere of
 negation. He desires no more than to show that revealed religion
 confers no advantages which are not already secured by natural
 religion. "The revealed law contains no moral precept which I do not
 find recommended and practised under the law of nature; therefore it
 has taught us nothing new upon morality. The revealed law has brought
 us no new truth; for what is a truth but a proposition referring to an
 object, conceived in terms which present clear ideas to me, and the
 connection of which with one another is intelligible to me? Now
 revealed religion has introduced no such propositions to us. What it
 has added to the natural law consists of five or six propositions
 which are not a whit more intelligible to me than if they were
 expressed in ancient Carthaginian, inasmuch as the ideas represented
 by the terms, and the connection among these ideas, escape me
 entirely."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

 <p>There is no sign in this piece that Diderot had examined the
 positive grounds of natural religion, or that he was ready with any
 adequate answer to the argument which Butler had brought forward in
 the previous decade of the century. We do not see that he is aware as
 yet of there being as valid objections on his own sceptical principles
 to the alleged data of naturalistic deism, as to the pretensions of a
 supernatural religion. He was content with Shaftesbury's position.</p>

 <p>Shaftesbury's influence on Diderot was permanent. It did not long
 remain so full and entire as it was now in the sphere of religious
 belief, but the traces of it never disappeared from his notions on
 morals and art. Shaftesbury's cheerfulness and geniality in
 philosophising were thoroughly sympathetic to Diderot. The optimistic
 harmony which the English philosopher, coming after Leibnitz, assumed
 as the starting-point of his ethical and religious ideas, was not only
 highly congenial to Diderot's sanguine temperament; it was a most
 attractive way of escape from the disorderly and confused theological
 wilderness of sin, asceticism, miracle, and the other monkeries. This
 naturalistic religion may seem a very unsafe and comfortless
 halting-place to us. But to men who heard of religion only in
 connection with the Bull Unigenitus and confessional certificates,
 with some act of intolerance or cruelty, with futile disputes about
 grace and the Five Propositions, the naturalism which Shaftesbury
 taught in prose and Pope versified was like the dawn after the
 foulness of night. Those who wished to soften the inhuman rigour of
 the criminal procedure of the time<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id=
 "FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class=
 "fnanchor">[39]</a> used to appeal from customary ordinances and
 written laws to the law natural. The law natural was announced to have
 preceded any law of human devising. In the same way, those who wished
 to disperse the darkness of unintelligible dogmas and degraded
 ecclesiastical usages, appealed to the simplicity, light, and purity
 of that natural religion which was supposed to have been overlaid and
 depraved by the special superstitions of the different communities of
 the world.</p>

 <p>"Pope's Essay on Man," wrote Voltaire after his return from England
 (1728), "seems to me the finest didactic poem, the most useful, the
 most sublime, that was ever written in any tongue. 'Tis true the whole
 substance of it is to be found in Shaftesbury's Characteristics, and I
 do not know why Pope gives all the honour of it to Bolingbroke,
 without saying a word of the celebrated Shaftesbury, the pupil of
 Locke."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The ground of this
 enthusiastic appreciation of the English naturalism was not merely
 that it made morality independent of religion, which Shaftesbury took
 great pains to do. It also identified religion with all that is
 beautiful and harmonious in the universal scheme. It surrounded the
 new faith with a pure and lofty poetry, that enabled it to confront
 the old on more than equal terms of dignity and elevation.
 Shaftesbury, and Diderot after him, ennobled human nature by placing
 the principle of virtue, the sense of goodness, within the breast of
 man. Diderot held to this idea throughout, as we shall see. That he
 did so explains a kind of phraseology about virtue and morality in his
 letters to Madame Voland and elsewhere, which would otherwise sound
 disagreeably like cant. Finally, Shaftesbury's peculiar attribution of
 beauty to morality, his reference of ethical matters to a kind of
 taste, the tolerably equal importance attributed by him to a sense of
 beauty and to the moral sense, all impressed Diderot with a mark that
 was not effaced. In the text of the Inquiry the author pronounces it a
 childish affectation in the eyes of any man who weighs things maturely
 to deny that there is in moral beings, just as in corporeal objects, a
 true and essential beauty, a real sublime. The eagerness with which
 Diderot seized on this idea from the first, is shown in the
 declamatory foot-note which he here appends to his original.<a name=
 "FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41"
 class="fnanchor">[41]</a> It was the source, by a process of inverted
 application, of that ethical colouring in his criticisms on art which
 made them so new and so interesting, because it carried æsthetic
 beyond technicalities, and associated it with the real impulses and
 circumstances of human life.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id=
 "FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class=
 "fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

 <p>One of Diderot's writings composed about our present date (1747),
 the Promenade du Sceptique, did not see the light until after his
 death. His daughter tells us that a police agent came one day to the
 house, and proceeded to search the author's room. He found a
 manuscript, said, "Good, that is what I am looking for," thrust it
 into his pocket, and went away. Diderot did his best to recover his
 piece, but never succeeded.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id=
 "FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class=
 "fnanchor">[43]</a> A copy of it came into the hands of Naigeon, and
 it seems to have been retained by Malesherbes, the director of the
 press, out of goodwill to the author. If it had been printed, it would
 certainly have cost him a sojourn in Vincennes.</p>

 <p>We have at first some difficulty in realising how he police could
 know the contents of an obscure author's desk. For one thing we have
 to remember that Paris, though it had been enormously increased in the
 days of Law and the System (1719-20), was still of a comparatively
 manageable size. In 1720, though the population of the whole realm was
 only fourteen or fifteen millions, that of Paris had reached no less a
 figure than a million and a half. After the explosion of the System,
 its artificial expansion naturally came to an end. By the middle of
 the century the highest estimate of the population does not make it
 much more than eight hundred thousand.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id=
 "FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class=
 "fnanchor">[44]</a> This, unlike the socially unwholesome and
 monstrous agglomerations of Paris or London in our own time, was a
 population over which police supervision might be made tolerably
 effective. It was more like a very large provincial town. Again, the
 inhabitants were marked off into groups or worlds with a definiteness
 that is now no longer possible. One-fifth of the population, for
 instance, consisted of domestic servants.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id=
 "FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class=
 "fnanchor">[45]</a> There were between twenty-eight and thirty
 thousand professional beggars.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id=
 "FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class=
 "fnanchor">[46]</a> The legal circle was large, and was deeply
 engrossed by its own interests and troubles. The world of authorship,
 though extremely noisy and profoundly important, still made only a
 small group. One effect of a censorship is to produce much gossip and
 whispering about suspected productions before they see the light, and
 these whispers let the police into as many secrets as they choose to
 know.</p>

 <p>In Diderot's case, his unsuspecting good-nature to all comers made
 his affairs accessible enough. His house was the resort of all the
 starving hacks in Paris, and he has left us more than one graphic
 picture of the literary drudge of that time. He writes, for instance,
 about a poor devil to whom he had given a manuscript to copy. "The
 time for which he had promised it to me expired, and as my man did not
 appear, I became uneasy, and started in search of him. I found him in
 a hole about as big as my fist, almost pitch-dark, without the
 smallest scrap of curtain or hanging to cover the nakedness of his
 walls, a couple of straw-bottomed chairs, a truckle-bed with a quilt
 riddled by the moths, a box in the corner of the chimney and rags of
 every sort stuck upon it, a small tin lamp to which a bottle served as
 support, and on a shelf some dozen first-rate books. I sat talking
 there for three-quarters of an hour. My man was as bare as a worm,
 lean, black, dry, but perfectly serene. He said nothing, but munched
 his crust of bread with good appetite, and bestowed a caress from time
 to time on his beloved, on the miserable bedstead that took up
 two-thirds of his room. If I had never learnt before that happiness
 resides in the soul, my Epictetus of Hyacinth Street would have taught
 it me right thoroughly."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id=
 "FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class=
 "fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

 <p>The history of one of these ragged clients is to our point. "Among
 those," he wrote to Madame Voland,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id=
 "FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class=
 "fnanchor">[48]</a> "whom chance and misery sent to my address was one
 Glénat, who knew mathematics, wrote a good hand, and was in want of
 bread. I did all I could to extricate him from his embarrassments. I
 went begging for customers for him on every side. If he came at
 meal-times, i would not let him go; if he lacked shoes, I gave him
 them; now and then I slipped a shilling into his hands as well. he had
 the air of the worthiest man in the world, and he even bore his
 neediness with a certain gaiety that used to amuse me. I was fond of
 chatting with him; he seemed to set little store by fortune, fame, and
 most of the other things that charm or dazzle us in life. Seven or
 eight days ago Damilaville wrote to send this man to him, for one of
 his friends who had a manuscript for him to copy. I send him; the
 manuscript is entrusted to him—a work on religion and government. i do
 not know how it came about, but that manuscript is now in the hands of
 the lieutenant of police. Damilaville gives me word of this. I hasten
 to my friend Glénat, to warn him to count no more upon me. 'And why am
 I not to count upon you?' 'Because you are a marked man. The police
 have their eyes upon you and 'tis impossible to send work to you.'
 'But, my dear sir, there's no risk, so long as you entrust nothing
 reprehensible to my hands. The police only come here when they scent
 game. I cannot tell how they do it, but they are never mistaken.' 'Ah
 well, I at any rate know how it is, and you have let me see much more
 in the the matter than I ever expected to learn from you,' and with
 that I turn my back on my rascal." Diderot having occasion to visit
 the lieutenant of police, introduced the matter, and could not
 withhold an energetic remonstrance against such an odious abuse of a
 man's kindness of heart, as the introduction of spies to his fireside.
 M. de Sartine laughed and Diderot took his leave, vowing that all the
 wretches who should come to him for the future, with cuffs dirty and
 torn, with holes in their stockings and holes in their shoes, with
 hair all unkempt, in shabby overcoats with many rents, or scanty black
 suits with starting seams, with all the tones and looks of distressed
 worth, would henceforth seem to him no better than police emissaries
 and scoundrels set to spy on him. The vow, we may be sure, was soon
 forgotten, but the story shows how seriously in one respect the man of
 letters in France was worse off than his brother in England.</p>

 <p>The world would have suffered no irreparable loss if the police had
 thrown the Sceptic's Walk into the fire. It is an allegory designed to
 contrast the life of religion, the life of philosophy, and the life of
 sensual pleasure. Of all forms of composition, an allegory most
 depends for its success upon the rapidity of the writer's eye for new
 felicities. Accuracy, verisimilitude, sustention, count for nothing in
 comparison with imaginative adroitness and variety. Bunyan had such an
 eye, and so, with infinitely more vivacity, had Voltaire. Diderot had
 not the deep sincerity or realism of conviction of the one; nor had he
 the inimitable power of throwing himself into a fancy, that was
 possessed by the other. He was the least agile, the least felicitous,
 the least ready, of composers. His allegory of the avenue of thorns,
 the avenue of chestnut-trees, and the avenue of flowers, is an
 allegory, unskilful, obvious, poor, and not any more amusing than if
 it's matter had been set forth without any attempt at fanciful
 decoration. The blinded saints among the thorns, and the voluptuous
 sinners among the flowers, are rather mechanical figures. The
 translation into the dialect required by the allegorical situation, of
 a sceptic's aversion for gross superstition on the one hand, and for
 gross hedonism on the other, is forced and wooden. The most
 interesting of the three sections is the second, containing a
 discussion in which the respective parts are taken by a deist, a
 pantheist, a subjective idealist, a sceptic, and an atheist. The
 allegory falls into the background, and we have a plain statement of
 some of the objections that may be made by the sceptical atheist both
 to revelation and to natural religion. A starry sky calls forth the
 usual glorification of the maker of so much beauty. "That is all
 imagination," rejoins the atheist. "It is mere presumption. We have
 before us an unknown machine, on which certain observations have been
 made. Ignorant people who have only examined a single wheel of it, of
 which they hardly know more than a tooth or two, form conjectures upon
 the way in which their cogs fit in with a hundred thousand other
 wheels. And then to finish like artisans, they label the work with the
 name of it's author."</p>

 <p>The defender justifies this by the argument from a repeater-watch,
 of which Paley and others have made so much use. We at once ascribe
 the structure and movement of a repeater-watch to intelligent
 creation. "No—things are not equal," says the atheist. "You are
 comparing a finished work, whose origin and manufacture we know, to an
 infinite piece of complexity, whose beginnings, whose present
 condition, and whose end are all alike unknown, and about whose author
 you have nothing better than guesses."</p>

 <p>But does not its structure announce an author? "No; you do not see
 who nor what he is. Who told you that the order you admire here belies
 itself nowhere else? Are you allowed to conclude from a point in space
 to infinite space? You pile a vast piece of ground with earth-heaps
 thrown here or there by chance, but among which the worm and the ant
 find convenient dwelling-places enough. What would you think of these
 insects, if, reasoning after your fashion, they fell into raptures
 over the intelligence of the gardener who had arranged all these
 materials so delightfully for their convenience?"<a name=
 "FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49"
 class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

 <p>In this rudimentary form the chief speaker presses some of the
 objections to optimistic deism from the point of view of the fixed
 limitations, the inevitable relativity, of human knowledge. This kind
 of objection had been more pithily expressed by Pascal long before, in
 the famous article of his Thoughts, on the difficulty of demonstrating
 the existence of a deity by light of nature.<a name="FNanchor_50_50"
 id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class=
 "fnanchor">[50]</a> Diderot's argument does not extend to dogmatic
 denial. It only shows that the deist is exposed to an attack from the
 same sceptical armoury from which he had drawn his own weapons for
 attacking revelation. It is impossible to tell how far Diderot went at
 this moment. The trenchancy with which his atheist urges his
 reasoning, proves that the writer was fully alive to its force. On the
 other hand, the atheist is left in the midst of a catastrophe. On his
 return home, he finds his children murdered, his house pillaged, and
 his wife carried off. And we are told that he could not complain on
 his own principles.</p>

 <p>If the absence of witnesses allowed the robber to commit his crime
 with impunity, why should he not? Again, there is a passage in which
 the writer seems to be speaking his own opinions. An interlocutor
 maintains the importance of keeping the people in bondage to certain
 prejudices. "What prejudices? If a man once admits the existence of a
 God, the reality of moral good and evil, the immortality of the soul,
 future rewards and punishments, what need has he of prejudices?
 Supposing him initiated in all the mysteries of transubstantiation,
 consubstantiation, the Trinity, hypostatical union, predestination,
 incarnation, and the rest, will he be any the better citizen?"<a name=
 "FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51"
 class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

 <p>In truth, Diderot's mind was at this time floating in an atmosphere
 of rationalistic negation, and the moral of his piece, as he hints,
 points first to the extravagance of Catholicism, next to the vanity of
 the pleasures of the world, and lastly, to the unfathomable
 uncertainty of philosophy. Still, we may discern a significant leaning
 towards the theory of the eternity of matter, which has arranged
 itself and assumed variety of form by virtue of its inherent quality
 of motion.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

 <p>It is a characteristic and displeasing mark of the time that
 Diderot in the midst of these serious speculations, should have set
 himself (1748) to the composition of a story in the kind which the
 author of the <i>Sofa</i> had made highly popular. The mechanism of
 this deplorable piece is more grossly disgusting—I mean æsthetically,
 not morally—than anything to be found elsewhere in the too voluminous
 library of impure literature. The idea would seem to have been
 borrowed from one of the old Fabliaux.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id=
 "FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class=
 "fnanchor">[53]</a> But what is tolerable in the quaint and
 <i>naïf</i> verse of the twelfth or thirteenth century, becomes
 shocking when deliberately rendered by a grave man into bald
 unblushing prose of the eighteenth. The humour, the rich sparkle, the
 wit, the merry <i>gaillardise</i>, have all vanished; we are left with
 the vapid dregs of an obscene anachronism. Mr. Carlyle, who knows how
 to be manly in these matters, and affects none of the hypocritical
 airs of our conventional criticism, yet has not more energetically
 than truly pronounced this "the beastliest of all past, present, or
 future dull novels." As "the next mortal creature, even a Reviewer,
 again compelled to glance into that book," I have felt the propriety
 of our humorist's injunction to such a one, "to bathe himself in
 running water, put on change of raiment, and be unclean until the
 even." Diderot himself, as might have been expected, soon had the
 grace to repent him of this shameful book, and could never hear it
 mentioned without a very lively embarrassment.<a name="FNanchor_54_54"
 id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class=
 "fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

 <p>As I have said before,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id=
 "FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class=
 "fnanchor">[55]</a> it was such books as this, as Crébillon's novels,
 as Duclos's Confessions du Comte</p>

 <p>X., and the dissoluteness of manners indicated by them, which
 invested Rousseau's New Heloïsa (1761) with its delightful and
 irresistible fascinations. Having pointed out elsewhere the
 significance of the licentiousness from which the philosophic party
 did not escape untainted,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id=
 "FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class=
 "fnanchor">[56]</a> I need not here do more than make two short
 remarks. First, the corruption which had seized the court after the
 death of Lewis XIV. in the course of a few years had reached the
 middle class in the town. The loosening of social fibre, caused by the
 insenate speculation at the time of Law, no doubt furthered the spread
 of demoralisation. Second, the reaction against the Church involved
 among its other elements a passionate contempt for all asceticism.
 This happened to fall in with the general relaxation of morals that
 followed Lewis's gloomy rigour. Consequently even men of pure life,
 like Condorcet, carried the theoretical protest against asceticism so
 far as to vindicate the practical immorality of the time. This is one
 of those enormous drawbacks that people seldom take into account when
 they are enumerating the blessings of superstition. Mediæval
 superstition had produced some advantages, but now came the set-off.
 Durable morality had been associated with a transitory religious
 faith. The faith fell into intellectual discredit, and sexual morality
 shared its decline for a short season. This must always be the natural
 consequence of building sound ethics on the shifting sands and rotting
 foundations of theology.</p>

 <p>Such literature as these tales of Diderot's, was the mirror both of
 the ordinary practical sentiment and the philosophic theory. A nation
 pays dearly for one of those outbreaks, when they happen to stamp
 themselves in a literary form that endures. There are those who hold
 that Louvet's Faublas is to this day a powerful agent in the
 depravation of the youth of France. Diderot, however, had not the most
 characteristic virtues of French writing; he was no master in the art
 of the <i>naïf</i>, nor in delicate malice, nor in sprightly cynicism.
 His book, consequently, has not lived, and we need not waste more
 words upon it. <i>Chaque esprit a sa lie</i>, wrote one who for a
 while had sat at Diderot's feet;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id=
 "FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class=
 "fnanchor">[57]</a> and we may dismiss this tale as the lees of
 Diderot's strong, careless, sensualised understanding. He was
 afterwards the author of a work, La Religieuse, on which the
 superficial critic may easily pour out the vials of affected wrath.
 There, however, he was executing a profound pathological study in a
 serious spirit. If the subject is horrible, we have to blame the
 composition of human character, or the mischievousness of a human
 institution. La Religieuse is no continuation of the vein of
 defilement which began and ended with the story of 1748—a story which
 is one among so many illustrations of Guizot's saying about the
 eighteenth century, that it was the most tempting and seductive of all
 centuries, for it promised full satisfaction at once to all the
 greatnesses of humanity and to all its weaknesses. Hettner quotes a
 passage from the minor writings of Niebuhr, in which the historian
 compares Diderot with Petronius, as having both of them been honest
 and well-intentioned men, who in shameless times were carried towards
 cynicism by their deep contempt for the prevailing vice. "If Diderot
 were alive now," says Niebuhr, "and if Petronius had only lived in the
 fourth instead of the third century, then the painting of obscenity
 would have been odious to them, and the inducement to it infinitely
 smaller."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> There is no trace in
 Diderot of this deep contempt for the viciousness of his time. All
 that can be said is that he did not escape it in his earlier years, in
 spite of the natural wholesomeness and rectitude of his character.</p>

 <p>It is worthy of remark that the dissoluteness of the middle portion
 of the century was not associated with the cynical and contemptuous
 view about women that usually goes with relaxed morality. There was a
 more or less distinct consciousness of a truth which has ever since
 grown into clearer prominence with the advance of thought since the
 Revolution. It is that the sphere and destiny of women are among the
 three or four foremost questions in social improvement. This is now
 perceived on all sides, profound as are the differences of opinion
 upon the proper solution of the problem. A hundred years ago this
 perception was vague and indefinite, but there was an unmistakable
 apprehension that the Catholic ideal of womanhood was no more adequate
 to the facts of life, than Catholic views about science, or property,
 or labour, or political order and authority.</p>

 <p>Diderot has left some curious and striking reflections upon the
 fate and character of women. He gives no signs of feeling after social
 reorganisation; he only speaks as one brooding in uneasy meditation
 over a very mournful perplexity. There is no sentimentalising, after
 the fashion of Jean Jacques. He does not neglect the plain physical
 facts, about which it is so difficult in an age of morbid reserve to
 speak with freedom, yet about which it is fatal to be silent. He
 indulged in none of those mischievous flatteries of women, which
 satisfy narrow observers, or coxcombs, or the uxorious. "Never
 forget," he said, "that for lack of reflection and principles, nothing
 penetrates down to a certain profoundness of conviction in the
 understanding of women. The ideas of justice, virtue, vice, goodness,
 badness, float on the surface of their souls. They have preserved
 self-love and personal interest with all the energy of nature.
 Although more civilized than we are outwardly, they have remained true
 savages inwardly.... It is in the passion of love, the access of
 jealousy, the transports of maternal tenderness, the instants of
 superstition, the way in which they show epidemic and popular notions,
 that women amaze us; fair as the seraphin of Klopstock, terrible as
 the fiends of Milton.... The distractions of a busy and contentious
 life break up our passions. A woman, on the contrary, broods over her
 passions; they are a fixed point on which her idleness or the
 frivolity of her duties holds her attention fast.... Impenetrable in
 dissimulation, cruel in vengeance, tenacious in their designs, without
 scruples about the means of success, animated by a deep and secret
 hatred against the despotism of man—it seems as if there were among
 them a sort of league, such as exists among the priests of all
 nations.... The symbol of women in general is that of the Apocalypse,
 on the front of which is inscribed <i>Mystery</i>.... If we have more
 reason than women have, they have far more instinct than we
 have."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> All this was said in no
 bitterness, but in the spirit of the strong observer.</p>

 <p>Cynical bitterness is as misplaced as frivolous adulation. Diderot
 had a deep pity for women. Their physical weaknesses moved him to
 compassion. To these are added the burden of their maternal function,
 and the burden of unequal laws. "The moment which shall deliver the
 girl from subjection to her parents is come; her imagination opens to
 a future thronged by chimæras; her heart swims in secret delight.
 Rejoice while thou canst, luckless creature! Time would have weakened
 the tyranny that thou hast left; time will strengthen the tyranny that
 awaits thee. They choose a husband for her. She becomes a mother. It
 is in anguish, at the peril of their lives, at the cost of their
 charms, often to the damage of their health, that they give birth to
 their little ones. The organs that mark their sex are subject to two
 incurable maladies. There is, perhaps, no joy comparable to that of
 the mother as she looks on her first-born; but the moment is dearly
 bought. Time advances, beauty passes; there come the years of neglect,
 of spleen, of weariness. 'Tis in pain that Nature disposes them for
 maternity; in pain and illness, dangerous and prolonged, she brings
 maternity to its close. What is a woman after that? Neglected by her
 husband, left by her children, a nullity in society, then piety
 becomes her one and last resource. In nearly every part of the world,
 the cruelty of the civil laws against women is added to the cruelty of
 Nature. They have been treated like weak-minded children. There is no
 sort of vexation which, among civilised peoples, man cannot inflict
 upon woman with impunity."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id=
 "FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class=
 "fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

 <p>The thought went no further, in Diderot's mind, than this pathetic
 ejaculation. He left it to the next generation, to Condorcet and
 others, to attack the problem practically; effectively to assert the
 true theory that we must look to social emancipation in women, and
 moral discipline in men, to redress the physical disadvantages.
 Meanwhile Diderot deserves credit for treating the position and
 character of women in a civilised society with a sense of reality; and
 for throwing aside those faded gallantries of poetic and literary
 convention, that screen a broad and dolorous gulf.</p>

 <h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />
 THE NEW PHILOSOPHY.</h2>

 <p>It is a common prejudice to treat Voltaire as if he had done
 nothing save write the Pucelle and mock at Habakkuk. Every serious and
 instructed student knows better. Voltaire's popularisation of the
 philosophy of Newton (1738) was a stimulus of the greatest importance
 to new thought in France. In a chapter of this work he had explained
 with his usual matchless terseness and lucidity Berkeley's theory of
 vision. The principle of this theory is, as every one knows, that
 figures, magnitudes, situations, distances, are not sensations but
 inferences; they are not the immediate revelations of sight, but the
 products of association and intellectual construction; they are not
 directly judged by vision, but by imagination and experience. If this
 be so, neither situation, nor distance, nor magnitude, nor figure,
 would be at once discerned by one born blind, supposing him suddenly
 to receive sight. Voltaire then describes the results of the operation
 performed by Cheselden (1728) on a lad who had been blind from his
 birth. This experiment was believed to confirm all that Locke and
 Berkeley had foreseen, for it was long before the patient could
 distinguish objects by size, distance, or shape.<a name=
 "FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61"
 class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Condillac had renewed the interest which
 Voltaire had first kindled in the subject, by referring to Cheselden's
 experiment in his first work, which was published in 1746.<a name=
 "FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62"
 class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

 <p>It happened that in 1748 Réaumur couched the eyes of a girl who had
 been born blind. Diderot sought to be admitted to the operation, but
 the favour was denied him, and he expressed his resentment in terms
 which, as we shall see, cost him very dear. As he could not witness
 the experiment, he began to meditate upon the subject, and the result
 was the <i>Letter on the Blind for the Use of those who See</i>.
 published in 1749—the date, it may be observed in passing, of another
 very important work in the development of materialistic speculation,
 David Hartley's <i>Observations on man, his frame, his duty, and his
 expectations</i>. Diderot's real disappointment at not being admitted
 to the operation was slight. In a vigorous passage he shows the
 difficulties in the way of conducting such an experiment under the
 conditions necessary to make it conclusive. To prepare the born-blind
 to answer philosophical interrogatories truly, and then to put these
 interrogatories rightly, would have been a feat, he declares, not
 unworthy of the united talents of Newton, Descartes, Locke, and
 Leibnitz. Unless the patient were placed in such conditions as this,
 Diderot thinks there would be more profit in questioning a blind
 person of good sense, than in the answers of an uneducated person
 receiving sight for the first time under abnormal and bewildering
 circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id=
 "FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class=
 "fnanchor">[63]</a> In this he was undoubtedly right. If the
 experiment could be prepared under the delicate conditions proper to
 make it demonstrative evidence, it would be final. But the experiment
 had certainly not been so prepared in his time, and probably never
 will be.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

 <p>Read in the light of the rich and elaborate speculative literature
 which England is producing in our own day, Diderot's once famous
 Letter on the Blind seems both crude and loose in its thinking. Yet
 considering the state of philosophy in France at the time of its
 appearance, we are struck by the acuteness, the good sense, and the
 originality of many of its positions. It was the first effective
 introduction into France of these great and fundamental principles;
 that all knowledge is relative to our intelligence, that thought is
 not the measure of existence, nor the conceivableness of a proposition
 the test of its truth, and that our experience is not the limit to the
 possibilities of things. That is an impatient criticism which
 dismisses the French philosophers with some light word as radically
 shallow and impotent. Diderot grasped the doctrine of Relativity in
 some of the most important and far-reaching of all its bearings. The
 fact that he and his allies used the doctrine as a weapon of combat
 against the standing organisation, is exactly what makes their history
 worth writing about. The standing organisation was the antagonistic
 doctrine incarnate. It made anthropomorphism and the absolute the very
 base and spring alike of individual and of social life. No growth was
 possible until this speculative base had been transformed. Hence the
 profound significance of what looks like a mere discussion of one of
 the minor problems of metaphysics. Diderot was not the first to
 discover Relativity, nor did he establish it; but it was he who
 introduced it into the literature of his country at the moment when
 circumstances were ripe for it.</p>

 <p>Condillac, as we have said, had published his first work, the Essay
 on the Origin of Human Knowledge, three years before (1746). This was
 a simple and undeveloped rendering of the doctrine of Locke, that the
 ultimate source of our notions lies in impressions made upon the
 senses, shaped and combined by reflection. It was not until 1754 that
 Condillac published his more celebrated treatise on the Sensations, in
 which he advanced a stride beyond Locke, and instead of tracing our
 notions to the double source of sensation and reflection, maintained
 that reflection itself is nothing but sensation "differently
 transformed." In the first book, again, he had disputed Berkeley's
 theory of vision: in the second, he gave a reasoned adhesion to it.
 Now Diderot and Condillac had first been brought together by Rousseau,
 when all three were needy wanderers about the streets of Paris. They
 used to dine together once a week at a tavern, and it was Diderot who
 persuaded a bookseller to give Condillac a hundred crowns for his
 first manuscript. "The Paris booksellers," says Rousseau, "are very
 arrogant and harsh to beginners; and metaphysics, then extremely
 little in fashion, did not offer a very particularly attractive
 subject."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The constant intercourse
 between Diderot and Condillac in the interval between the two works of
 the great apostle of Sensationalism, may well account for the
 remarkable development in doctrine. This is one of the many examples
 of the share of Diderot's energetic and stimulating intelligence, in
 directing and nourishing the movement of the time, its errors and
 precipitancies included. On the other hand, the share of Condillac in
 providing a text for Diderot's first considerable performance, is
 equally evident.</p>

 <p>The Letter on the Blind is an inquiry how far a modification of the
 five senses, such as the congenital absence of one of them, would
 involve a corresponding modification of the ordinary notions acquired
 by men who are normally endowed in their capacity for sensation. It
 considers the Intellect in a case where it is deprived of one of the
 senses. The writer opens with an account of a visit made by himself
 and some friends to a man born blind at Puisaux, a place seventy miles
 from Paris. They asked him in what way he thought of the eyes. "They
 are an organ on which the air produces the same effect as my stick
 upon my hand." A mirror he described "as a machine which sets things
 in relief away from themselves, if they are properly placed in
 relation to it." This conception had formed itself in his mind in the
 following way. The blind man only knows objects by touch. He is aware,
 on the testimony of others, that we know objects by sight as he knows
 them by touch; he can form no other notion. He is aware, again, that a
 man cannot see his own face, though he can touch it. Sight, then, he
 concludes, is a sort of touch, which only extends to objects different
 from our own visage, and remote from us. Now touch only conveys to him
 the idea of relief. A mirror, therefore, must be a machine which sets
 us in relief out of ourselves. How many philosophers, cries Diderot,
 have employed less subtlety to reach notions just as untrue?</p>

 <p>The born-blind had a memory for sound in a surprising degree, and
 countenances do not present more diversity to us than he observed in
 voices. The voice has for such persons an infinite number of delicate
 shades that escape us, because we have not the same reason for
 attention that the blind have. The help that our senses lend to one
 another, is an obstacle to their perfection.</p>

 <p>The blind man said he should have been tempted to regard persons
 endowed with sight as superior intelligences, if he had not found out
 a hundred times how inferior we are in other respects. How do we
 know—Diderot reflects upon this—that all the animals do not reason in
 the same way, and look upon themselves as our equals or superiors,
 notwithstanding our more complex and efficient intelligence? They may
 accord to us a reason with which we should still have much need of
 their instinct while they claim to be endowed with an instinct which
 enables them to do very well without our reason.</p>

 <p>When asked whether he should be glad to have sight, the born-blind
 replied that, apart from curiosity, he would be just as well pleased
 to have long arms: his hands would tell him what is going on in the
 moon, better than our eyes or telescopes; and the eyes cease to see
 earlier than the hands lose the sense of touch. It would therefore be
 just as good to perfect in him the organ that he had, as to confer
 upon him another which he had not. This is untrue. No conceivable
 perfection of touch would reveal phenomena of light, and the longest
 arms must leave those phenomena undisclosed.</p>

 <p>After recounting various other peculiarities of thought, Diderot
 notices that the blind man attaches slight importance to the sense of
 shame. He would hardly understand the utility of clothes, for
 instance, except as a protection against cold. He frankly told his
 philosophising visitors that he could not see why one part of the body
 should be covered rather than another. "I have never doubted," says
 Diderot, "that the state of our organs and senses has much influence
 both on our metaphysics and our morality." This, I may observe, does
 not in the least show that in a society of human beings, not blind,
 but endowed with vision, the sense of physical shame is a mere
 prejudice of which philosophy will rid us. The fact that a blind man
 discerns no ill in nakedness, has no bearing on the value or
 naturalness of shame among people with eyes. And moreover, the fact
 that delicacy or shame is not a universal human impulse, but is
 established, and its scope defined, by a varying etiquette, does not
 in the least affect the utility or wisdom of such an artificial
 establishment and definition. The grounds of delicacy, though
 connected with the senses, are fixed by considerations that spring
 from the social reason. It seems to be true, as Diderot says, that the
 born-blind are at first without physical delicacy; because delicacy
 has its root in the consciousness that we are observed, while the
 born-blind are not conscious that they are observed. It is found that
 one of the most important parts of their education is to impress this
 knowledge upon them.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id=
 "FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class=
 "fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

 <p>But the artificiality of a moral acquisition is obviously no test
 of its worth, nor of the reasons for preserving it. Diderot exclaims,
 "Ah, madam, how different is the morality of a blind man from ours;
 and how the morality of the deaf would differ from that of the blind;
 and if a being should have a sense more than we have, how wofully
 imperfect would he find our morality!" This is plainly a crude and
 erroneous way of illustrating the important truth of the strict
 relativity of ethical standards and maxims. Diderot speaks as if they
 were relative simply and solely to our five wits, and would vary with
 them only. Everybody now has learnt that morality depends not merely
 on the five wits, but on the mental constitution within, and on the
 social conditions without. It is to these rather than to the number of
 our senses, that moral ideas are relative.</p>

 <p>Passing over various other remarks, we come to those pages in the
 Letter which apply the principle of relativity to the
 master-conception of God. Diderot's argument on this point naturally
 drew keener attention than the more disinterestedly scientific parts
 of his contribution. People were not strongly agitated by the question
 whether a blind man who had learned to distinguish a sphere from a
 cube by touch, would instantly identify each of them if he received
 sight.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

 <p>The question whether a blind man has as good reasons for believing
 in the existence of a God as a man with sight can find, was of more
 vivid interest. As a matter of fact, Diderot's treatment of the
 narrower question (pp. 324, etc.) is more closely coherent than his
 treatment of the wider one, for the simple reason that the special
 limitation of experience in the born-blind cannot fairly be made to
 yield any decisive evidence on the great, the insoluble enigma.</p>

 <p>Here, as in the other part of his essay, Diderot followed the
 method of interrogating the blind themselves. In this instance, he
 turned to the most extraordinary example in history, of intellectual
 mastery and scientific penetration in one who practically belonged to
 the class of the born-blind; and this too in dealing with subjects
 where sight might be thought most indispensable. From 1711 to 1739 one
 of the professors of mathematics at Cambridge was Nicholas Saunderson,
 who had lost his sight before he was twelve months old. He was a man
 of striking mental vigour, an original and efficient teacher, and the
 author of a book upon algebra which was considered meritorious in its
 day. His knowledge of optics was highly remarkable. He had distinct
 ideas of perspective, of the projections of the sphere, and of the
 forms assumed by plane or solid figures in certain positions. For
 performing computations he devised a machine of great ingenuity, which
 also served the purpose, with certain modifications, of representing
 geometrical diagrams. In religion he was a sceptic or something more,
 and in his last hours Diderot supposes him to have engaged in a
 discussion with a minister of religion, upon the arguments for the
 existence of a deity drawn from final causes. This discussion Diderot
 professes to reproduce, and he makes Saunderson discourse with much
 eloquence and some pathos.</p>

 <p>By one of those mystifications which make the French polemical
 literature of the eighteenth century the despair of bibliographers,
 Diderot cites as his authority a <i>Life of Saunderson</i>, by Dr.
 Inchlif. He sets forth the title with great circumstantiality, but no
 such book exists or ever did exist. The Royal Society of London,
 however, took the jest of fathering atheism on one of its members in
 bad part, and Diderot was systematically excluded from the honour of
 admission to that learned body, as he was excluded all his life from
 the French Academy.</p>

 <p>The reasoning which Diderot puts into the professor's mouth is at
 first a fervid enlargement of the text, that the argument drawn from
 the wonders of nature is very weak evidence for blind men. Our power
 of creating new objects, so to speak, by means of a little mirror, is
 far more incomprehensible to them, than the stars which they have been
 condemned never to behold. The luminous ball that moves from east to
 west through the heavens, is a less astonishing thing to them than the
 fire on the hearth which they can lessen or augment at
 pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> "Why talk to me," says
 Saunderson, "of all that fine spectacle which has never been made for
 me? I have been condemned to pass my life in darkness; and you cite
 marvels that I cannot understand, and that are only evidence for you
 and for those who see as you do. If you want me to believe in God, you
 must make me touch him." The minister replied that the sense of touch
 ought to be enough to reveal the divinity to him in the admirable
 mechanism of his organs. To this, Saunderson:—"I repeat, all that is
 not as fine for me as it is for you. But the animal mechanism, even
 were it as perfect as you pretend, and as I daresay it is—what has it
 in common with a Being of sovereign intelligence? If it fills you with
 astonishment, that is perhaps because you are in the habit of treating
 as a prodigy anything that strikes you as being beyond your own
 strength. I have been myself so often an object of admiration for you,
 that I have a poor opinion of what surprises you. I have attracted
 people from all parts of England, who could not conceive by what means
 I could work at geometry. Well, you must agree that such persons had
 not very exact notions about the possibility of things. Is a
 phenomenon in our notions beyond the power of man? Then we instantly
 say—<i>'Tis the handiwork of a God</i>. Nothing short of that can
 content our vanity. Why can we not contrive to throw into our talk
 less pride and more philosophy?. If nature offers us some knot that is
 hard to untie, let us leave it for what it is; do not let us employ
 for cutting it the hand of a Being, who then immediately becomes in
 turn a new knot for us, and a knot harder to untie than the first. An
 Indian tells you that our globe is suspended in the air on the back of
 an elephant. And the elephant! It stands on a tortoise. And the
 tortoise? what sustains that?... You pity the Indian: and yet one
 might very well say to you as to him—Mr. Holmes, my good friend,
 confess your ignorance, and spare me elephant and tortoise."<a name=
 "FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69"
 class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

 <p>The minister very naturally then falls back upon good authority,
 and asks Saunderson to take the word of Newton, Clarke, and Leibnitz.
 The blind man answers that though the actual state of the universe may
 be the illustration of a marvellous and admirable order, still Newton,
 Clarke, and Leibnitz must leave him freedom of opinion as to its
 earlier states. And then he foreshadows in a really singular and
 remarkable way that theory which is believed to be the great triumph
 of scientific discovery, and which is certainly the great stimulus to
 speculation, in our own time. As to anterior states "you have no
 witnesses to confront with me, and your eyes give you no help.
 Imagine, if you choose, that the order which strikes you so profoundly
 has subsisted from the beginning. But leave me free to think that it
 has done no such thing, and that if we went back to the birth of
 things and scenes, and perceived matter in motion and chaos slowly
 disentangling itself, we should come across a whole multitude of
 shapeless creatures, instead of a very few creatures highly organised.
 If I have no objection to make to what you say about the present
 condition of things, I may at least question you as to their past
 condition. I may at least ask of you, for example, who told you—you
 and Leibnitz and Clarke and Newton—that in the first instances of the
 formation of animals, some were not without heads and others without
 feet? I may maintain that these had no stomachs, and those no
 intestines; that some to whom a stomach, a palate, and teeth seemed to
 promise permanence, came to an end through some fault of heart or
 lungs; that the monsters annihilated one another in succession, that
 all the faulty (<i>vicieuses</i>) combinations of matter disappeared,
 and that <i>those only survived whose mechanism implied no important
 mis-adaptation</i> (contradiction), <i>and who had the power of
 supporting and perpetuating themselves</i>.</p>

 <p>"On this hypothesis, if the first man had happened to have his
 larynx closed, or had not found suitable food, or had been defective
 in the parts of generation, or had failed to find a mate, then what
 would have become of the human race? It would have been still enfolded
 in the general depuration of the universe; and that arrogant being who
 calls himself Man, dissolved and scattered among the molecules of
 matter, would perhaps have remained for all time hidden in the number
 of mere possibilities.</p>

 <p>"If shapeless creatures had never existed, you would not fail to
 insist that none will ever appear, and that I am throwing myself
 headlong into chimerical hypotheses. But the order is not even now so
 perfect, but that monstrous products appear from time to
 time."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

 <p>We have here a distinct enough conception, though in an exceedingly
 undigested shape, first, of incessant Variability in organisms as an
 actual circumstance, which we may see exemplified in its extreme form
 in the monstrous deviations of structure that occur from time to time
 before our own eyes; second, of Adaptation to environment as the
 determining condition of Survival among the forms that present
 themselves. Even as a bald and unsustained guess, this was an
 effective side-blow at the doctrine of final causes—a doctrine, as has
 been often remarked, which does not survive, in any given set of
 phenomena, the reduction of these phenomena to terms of matter and
 motion.</p>

 <p>"I conjecture then," continues Saunderson, enlarging the idea of
 the possibilities of matter and motion, "that in the beginning when
 matter in fermentation gradually brought our universe bursting into
 being, blind creatures like myself were very common. But why should I
 not believe of worlds what I believe of animals? How many worlds,
 mutilated and imperfect, were peradventure dispersed, then re-formed,
 and are again dispersing at each moment of time in those far-off
 spaces which I cannot touch and you cannot behold, but where motion
 combines and will continue to combine masses of matter, until they
 have chanced on some arrangement in which they may finally persevere!
 O philosophers, transport yourselves with me on to the confines of the
 universe, beyond the point where I feel, and you see, organised
 beings; gaze over that new ocean, and seek across its lawless, aimless
 heavings some vestiges of that intelligent Being whose wisdom strikes
 you with such wonder here!</p>

 <p>"What is this world? A complex whole, subject to endless
 revolutions. All these revolutions show a continual tendency to
 destruction; a swift succession of beings who follow one another,
 press forward, and vanish; a fleeting symmetry; the order of a moment.
 I reproached you just now with estimating the perfection of things by
 your own capacity; and I might accuse you here of measuring its
 duration by the length of your own days. You judge of the continuous
 existence of the world, as an ephemeral insect might judge of yours.
 The world is eternal for you, as you are eternal to the being that
 lives but for one instant. Yet the insect is the more reasonable of
 the two. For what a prodigious succession of ephemeral generations
 attests your eternity! What an immeasurable tradition! Yet shall we
 all pass away, without the possibility of assigning either the real
 extension that we filled in space, or the precise time that we shall
 have endured. Time, matter, space—all, it may be, are no more than a
 point."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

 <p>Diderot sent a copy of his work to Voltaire. The poet replied with
 his usual playful politeness, but declared his dissent from
 Saunderson, "who denied God, because he happened to have been born
 blind."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> More pretentious, and
 infinitely less acute critics than Voltaire, have fixed on the same
 point in the argument and met it by the same answer; namely, that,
 blind as he was, Saunderson ought to have recognised an intelligent
 Being who had provided him with so many substitutes for sight; he
 ought to have inferred a skilful demiurgus from those ordered
 relations in the universe, which Thought, independently of Vision,
 might well have disclosed to him. In truth, this is not the centre of
 the whole argument. When Saunderson implies that he could only admit a
 God on condition that he could touch him, he makes a single sense the
 channel of all possible ideas, and the arbiter of all reasoned
 combinations of ideas. This is absurd, and Diderot, as we have seen,
 rapidly passed away from that to the real strength of the position.
 All the rest of the contention against final causes would have come
 just as fitly from the lips of a man with vision, as from Saunderson.
 The hypothetical inference of a deity from the marvels of adaptation
 to be found in the universe is unjustified, among other reasons,
 because it ignores or leaves unexplained the marvels of mis-adaptation
 in the universe. It makes absolute through eternity a hypothesis which
 can at its best only be true relatively—not merely to the number of
 our senses, but—to a few partially chosen phenomena of our own little
 day. It explains a few striking facts; it leaves wholly unexplained a
 far greater number of equally striking facts, even if it be not
 directly contradicted by them. It is the invention of an imaginary
 agency to account for the scanty successes of creation, and an
 attribution to that agency of the kind of motives that might have
 animated a benevolent European living in the eighteenth century. It
 leaves wholly unaccounted for the prodigious host of monstrous or
 imperfect organisms, and the appalling law of merciless and incessant
 destruction.</p>

 <p>To us this is the familiar discussion of the day. But let us return
 to the starting-point of this chapter. In France a hundred and twenty
 years ago it was the first opening of a decisive breach in the walls
 that had sheltered the men of Western Europe against outer desolation
 for some fifteen centuries or more. The completeness of Catholicism,
 as a self-containing system of life and thought, is now harder for
 Protestants or Sceptics to realise, than any other fact in the whole
 history of human society. Catholicism was not only an institution, nor
 only a religious faith; it was also a philosophy and a systematised
 theory of the universe. The Church during its best age directed the
 moral relations of individual men, and attempted, more or less
 successfully, to humanise the relations of communities. It satisfied
 or stimulated the affections by its exaltation of the Virgin Mary as a
 supreme object of worship; it nourished the imagination on
 polytheistic legends of saints and martyrs; it stirred the religious
 emotions by touching and impressive rites; it surrounded its members
 with emblems of a special and invincible protection. Catholicism, we
 have again and again to repeat, claimed to deal with life as a whole,
 and to leave no province of nature, no faculty of man, no need of
 intelligence or spirit, uncomprehended. But we must not forget that,
 though this prodigious system had its root in the affections and
 sympathies of human nature, it was also fenced round by a theory of
 metaphysic. It rested upon authority and tradition, but it also sought
 an expression in an intellectual philosophy of things. The essence of
 this philosophy was to make man the final cause of the universe. Its
 interpretation of the world was absolute; its conception of the
 Creator was absolute; its account of our intellectual impressions, of
 our moral rules, of our spiritual ideals, made them all absolute. Now
 Diderot, when he wrote the Letter on the Blind, perceived that mere
 rationalistic attacks upon the sacred books, upon the miracles, upon
 the moral types, of Catholicism, could only be partially effective for
 destruction, and could have no effect at all in replacing the old ways
 of thinking by others of more solid truth. The attack must begin in
 philosophy. The first fruitful process must consist in shifting the
 point of view, in enlarging the range of the facts to be considered,
 in pressing the relativity of our ideas, in freeing ourselves from the
 tyranny of anthropomorphism.</p>

 <p>Hobbes's witty definition of the papacy as the ghost of the old
 Roman Empire sitting enthroned on the grave thereof, may tempt us to
 forget the all-important truth that the basis of the power of the
 ghost was essentially different from that of the dissolved body. The
 Empire was a political organisation, resting on military force. The
 Church was a social organisation, made vital by a conviction. The
 greatest fact in the intellectual history of the eighteenth century is
 the decisive revolution that overtook that sustaining conviction. The
 movement and the men whom we are studying owe all their interest to
 the share that they had in this immense task. The central conception,
 that the universe was called into existence only to further its
 Creator's purpose towards man, became incredible. This absolute
 proposition was slowly displaced by notions of the limitation of human
 faculties, and of the comparatively small portion of the whole cosmos
 or chaos to which we have reason to believe that these faculties give
 us access. To substitute this relative point of view for the absolute,
 was the all-important preliminary to the effectual breaking up of the
 great Catholic construction.</p>

 <p>What seems to careless observers a mere metaphysical dispute was in
 truth, and still is, the decisive quarter of the great battle between
 theology and a philosophy reconcilable with science. When the Catholic
 reaction set in, Joseph de Maistre, by far its acutest champion in the
 region of philosophy, at once made it his first business to attack the
 principle of relativity with all his force of dialectic, and to
 reinstate absolute modes of thinking, and the absolute quality of
 Catholic propositions about religion, knowledge, and
 government.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Yet neither he nor any one
 else on his side has ever effectively shaken the solid argument which
 Diderot fancifully illustrated in the following passage from his reply
 to Voltaire's letter of thanks for the opuscule: "This marvellous
 order and these wondrous adaptations, what am I to think of them? That
 they are metaphysical entities only existing in your own mind. You
 cover a vast piece of ground with a mass of ruins falling hither or
 thither at hazard; amid these the worm and the ant find commodious
 shelter enough. What would you say of these insects, if they were to
 take for real and final entities the relations of the places which
 they inhabit to their organisation, and then fall into ecstasies over
 the beauty of their subterranean architecture, and the wonderfully
 superior intelligence of the gardener who arranges things so
 conveniently for them?"<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id=
 "FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class=
 "fnanchor">[74]</a> This is the notion which Voltaire himself three
 years afterwards illustrated in the witty fancies of
 <i>Micromégas</i>. The little animalcule in the square cap, who makes
 the giant laugh in a Homeric manner by its inflated account of itself
 as the final cause of the universe, is the type of the philosophy on
 which Catholicism is based.</p>

 <p>In the same letter Diderot avows his dissent—hypocritically, we
 find reason for suspecting—from Saunderson's conclusion. "It is
 commonly in the night-time," he says, "that the mists arise which
 obscure in me the existence of God; the rising of the sun never fails
 to scatter them. But then the darkness is ever-enduring for the blind,
 and the sun only rises for those who see." Diderot's denial of atheism
 seems more than suspicious, when one finds him taking so much pains to
 make out Saunderson's case for him, when he urges the argument
 following, for instance: "If there had never existed any but material
 beings, there would never have been spiritual beings; for then the
 spiritual beings would either have given themselves existence, or else
 would have received it from the material beings. But if there had
 never existed any but spiritual beings, you will see that there would
 never have been material beings. Right philosophy only allows me to
 suppose in things what I can distinctly perceive in them. Now I
 perceive no other faculties distinctly in the mind except those of
 willing and thinking, and I no more conceive that thought and will can
 act on material beings or on nothing, than I can conceive material
 beings or nothing acting on spiritual beings." And he winds up his
 letter thus: "It is very important not to take hemlock for parsley;
 but not important at all to believe or to disbelieve in God. The
 world, said Montaigne, is a tennis-ball that he has given to
 philosophers to toss hither and thither; and I would say nearly as
 much of the Deity himself."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id=
 "FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class=
 "fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

 <p>In concluding our account of this piece, we may mention that
 Diderot threw out a hint, which is a good illustration of the alert
 and practically helpful way in which his mind was always seeking new
 ideas. We have common signs, he said, appealing to the eye, namely,
 written characters, and others appealing to the ear, namely,
 articulate sounds; we have none appealing to touch. "For want of such
 a language, communication is entirely broken between us and those who
 are born deaf, dumb, and blind. They grow, but they remain in a state
 of imbecility. Perhaps they would acquire ideas, if we made ourselves
 understood by them from childhood in a fixed, determinate, constant,
 and uniform manner; in short, if we traced on their hand the same
 characters that we trace upon paper, and invariably attached the same
 significance to them."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id=
 "FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class=
 "fnanchor">[76]</a> The patient benevolence and ingenuity of Dr. Howe
 of Boston has realised in our own day the value of Diderot's
 suggestion.</p>

 <p>One or two trifling points of literary interest may be noticed in
 the Letter on the Blind. Diderot refers to "the ingenious expression
 of an English geometer that <i>God geometrises</i>" (p. 294). He is
 unaware apparently of the tradition which attributes the expression to
 Plato, though it is not found in Plato's writings. Plutarch, I
 believe, is the first person who mentions the saying, and discusses
 what Plato exactly meant by it. In truth, it is one of that large
 class of dicta which look more ingenious than they are true. There is
 a fine Latin passage by Barrow on the mighty geometry of the universe,
 and the reader of the <i>Religio Medici</i> (p. 42) may remember that
 Sir Thomas Browne pronounces God to be "like a skilful
 geometrician."</p>

 <p>An odd coincidence of simile is worth mentioning. Diderot says
 "that great services are like large pieces of money, that we have
 seldom any occasion to use. Small attentions are a current coin that
 we always carry in our hands." This is curiously like the saying in
 the <i>Tatler</i> that "A man endowed with great perfections without
 good breeding is like one who has his pockets full of gold, but wants
 change for his ordinary occasions." Yet if Diderot had read the
 <i>Tatler</i>, he would certainly have referred to the story in No.
 55, how William Jones of Newington, born blind, was brought to sight
 at the age of twenty—a story told in a manner after Diderot's own
 heart.</p>

 <p>II.</p>

 <p>It is proper in this place to mention a short philosophic piece
 which Diderot wrote in 1751, his <i>Letter on the Deaf and Dumb for
 the Use of those who Hear and Talk</i>. This is not, like the Letter
 on the Blind, the examination of a case of the Intellect deprived of
 one or more of the senses. It is substantially a fragment, and a very
 important fragment, on Æsthetics, and as such there will be something
 to say about it in another chapter. But there are, perhaps, one or two
 points at which the Letter on the Deaf and Dumb touches the line of
 thought of the Letter on the Blind.</p>

 <p>The Letter opens on the question of the origin and limits of
 inversion in language. This at once leads to a discussion of the
 natural order of ideas and expressions, and that original order, says
 Diderot, we can only ascertain by a study of the language of gesture.
 Such a study can be pursued either in assiduous conversation with one
 who has been deaf and dumb from birth, or by the experiment of a
 <i>muet de convention</i>, a man who foregoes the use of articulate
 sounds for the sake of experiment as to the process of the formation
 of language. Generalising this idea, Diderot proceeds to consider man
 as distributed into as many distinct and separate beings as he has
 senses. "My idea would be to decompose a man, so to speak, and to
 examine what he derives from each of the senses with which he is
 endowed. I have sometimes amused myself with this kind of metaphysical
 anatomy; and I found that of all the senses, the eye was the most
 superficial; the ear, the proudest; smell, the most voluptuous; taste,
 the most superstitious and the most inconstant; touch, the profoundest
 and the most of a philosopher. It would be amusing to get together a
 society, each member of which should have no more than one sense;
 there can be no doubt that they would all treat one another as out of
 their wits."</p>

 <p>This is interesting, because it was said at the time to be the
 source of one of the most famous fancies in the philosophical
 literature of the century, the Statue in Condillac's Treatise on the
 Sensations. Condillac imagined a statue organised like a man, but each
 sense unfolding itself singly, at the will of an eternal arbiter. The
 philosopher first admits the exercise of smell to his Frankenstein,
 and enumerates the mental faculties which might be expected to be set
 in operation under the changing impressions made upon that one sense.
 The other senses are imparted to it in turn, one by one, each adding a
 new group of ideas to the previous stock, until at length the mental
 equipment is complete.</p>

 <p>We may see the extent of the resemblance between Condillac's Statue
 and Diderot's <i>muet de convention</i>, but Diderot at least is free
 from the charge of borrowing. Condillac's book was published three
 years (1754) after the Letter on the Deaf and Dumb, and he afterwards
 wrote a pamphlet defending himself from the charge of having taken the
 fancy of his Statue from Diderot; nor, for that matter, did Diderot
 ever make sign or claim in the matter. We have already spoken of the
 relations between the two philosophers, and though it is a mistake to
 describe Diderot as one of Condillac's most celebrated pupils,<a name=
 "FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77"
 class="fnanchor">[77]</a> yet there is just as little reason to invert
 the connection, or to doubt Condillac's own assertion that the Statue
 was suggested to him by Mademoiselle Ferrand, that remarkable woman to
 whose stimulating and directing influence he always professed such
 deep obligation. Attention has been called to the fact that in 1671 a
 Parisian bookseller published a Latin version of a much more
 intelligent and scientific fancy than the Statue—the <i>Philosophus
 Autodidactus</i> of the Arabian, Ibn Tophail. This was a romance, in
 which a human being is suckled by a gazelle on a desert island in the
 tropics, and grows up in the manner of some Robinson Crusoe with a
 turn for psychological speculation, and gradually becomes conscious,
 through observation, of the peculiar properties belonging to his
 senses.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

 <p>Of the part of the Letter that concerns gesture, one can only say
 that it appears astonishingly crude to those who know the progress
 that has been made since Diderot's time in collecting and generalising
 the curious groups of fact connected with gesture-language. We can
 imagine the eager interest that Diderot would have had in such curious
 observations as that gesture-language has something like a definite
 syntax; that it furnishes no means of distinguishing causation from
 sequence or simultaneity; that savages can understand and be
 understood with ease and certainty in a deaf-and-dumb school.<a name=
 "FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79"
 class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Diderot was acute enough to see that the
 questions of language could only be solved, not by the old
 metaphysical methods, but experientially. For the experiential method
 in this matter the time was not ripe. It was no wonder, then, that
 after a few pages, he broke away and hastened to æsthetics.</p>

 <p>III.</p>

 <p>Penalties on the publication of heretical opinion did not cease in
 England with the disappearance of the Licensing Act. But they were at
 least inflicted by law. It was the Court of King's Bench which, in
 1730, visited Woolston with fine and imprisonment, after all the forms
 of a prosecution had been duly gone through. It was no Bishop's court
 nor Star Chamber, much less a warrant signed by George the Third or by
 Bute, which in 1762 condemned Peter Annet to the pillory and the gaol
 for his Free Inquirer. The only evil which overtook Mandeville for his
 Fable of the Bees was to be harmlessly presented (1723) as a public
 nuisance by the Grand Jury of Middlesex. We may contrast with this the
 state of things which prepared a revolution in France.</p>

 <p>One morning in July, 1749—almost exactly forty years before that
 July of '89, so memorable in the annals of arbitrary government and
 state prisons—a commissary of police and three attendants came to
 Diderot's house, made a vigorous scrutiny of his papers, and then
 produced a warrant for his detention. The philosopher, without any
 ado, told his wife not to expect him home for dinner, stepped into the
 chaise, and was driven off with his escort to Vincennes. His real
 offence was a light sneer in the Letter on the Blind at the mistress
 of a minister.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id=
 "FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class=
 "fnanchor">[80]</a> The atheistical substance of the essay, however,
 apart from the pique of a favourite, would have given sufficiently
 good grounds for a prosecution in England, and in France for that vile
 substitute for prosecution, the <i>lettre-decachet</i>. And there
 happened to be special causes for harshness towards the press at this
 moment. Verses had been published satirising the king and his manner
 of life in bitter terms, and a stern raid was made upon all the
 scribblers in Paris. At the court there had just taken place one of
 those reactions in favour of the ecclesiastical party, which for
 thirty years in the court history alternated so frequently with
 movements in the opposite direction. The gossip of the town set down
 Diderot's imprisonment to a satire against the Jesuits, of which he
 was wrongly supposed to be the author.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id=
 "FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class=
 "fnanchor">[81]</a> It is not worth while to seek far for a reason,
 when authority was as able and as ready to thrust men into gaol for a
 bad reason as for a good one. The writer or the printer of a
 philosophical treatise was at this moment looked upon in France much
 as a magistrate now looks on the wretch who vends infamous prints.</p>

 <p>The lieutenant of police (Berryer) treated the miserable author
 with additional severity, for stubbornly refusing to give up the name
 of the printer. Diderot was well aware that the printer would be sent
 to the galleys for life, if the lieutenant of police could once lay
 hands upon him. This personage, we may mention, was afterwards raised
 to the dignified office of keeper of the seals, as a reward for his
 industry and skill in providing victims for the royal seraglio at
 Versailles.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The man who had ventured
 to use his mind, was thrown into the dungeon at Vincennes by the man
 who played spy and pander for the Pompadour. The official record of a
 dialogue between Berryer and Denis Diderot, "of the Catholic,
 Apostolic, and Roman religion," is a singular piece of reading, if we
 remember that the prisoner's answers were made, "after oath taken by
 the respondent to speak and answer the truth."</p>

 <p>"Interrogated if he has not composed a work entitled <i>Letters on
 the Blind</i>.</p>

 <p>"Answered no.</p>

 <p>"Interrogated by whom he had caused said work to be printed.</p>

 <p>"Answered that he had not caused the said work to be printed.</p>

 <p>"Interrogated if he knows the name of the author of the said
 work.</p>

 <p>"Answered that he knows nothing about it.</p>

 <p>"Interrogated whether he has not had said work in manuscript in his
 possession before it was printed.</p>

 <p>"Answered that he had not had the said manuscript in his possession
 before or after it was printed.</p>

 <p>"Interrogated whether he has not composed a work which appeared
 some years ago, entitled <i>Philosophic Thoughts</i>.</p>

 <p>"Answered no."</p>

 <p>And so, after a dozen more replies of equal veracity, on reading
 being made to the respondent of the present interrogatory, Diderot
 "said that the answers contain the truth, persisted in them, and
 signed," as witness his hand. A sorrowful picture, indeed, of the
 plight of an apostle of a new doctrine. On the other hand, the apostle
 of the new doctrine was perhaps good enough for the preachers of the
 old. Two years before this, the priest of the church of Saint Médard
 had thought it worth while to turn spy and informer. This is the
 report which the base creature sent to the lieutenant of police
 (1747):—</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>"Diderot, a man of no profession, living, etc., is a young man who
  plays the free-thinker, and glories in impiety. He is the author of
  several works of philosophy, in which he attacks religion. His talk
  is like his books. He is busy at the composition of one now, which is
  very dangerous."</p>
 </div>

 <p>The priest's delation was confirmed presently by a still lower
 agent of authority, who, in bad grammar and bad spelling, describes
 "this wretch Diderot as a very dangerous man, who speaks of the holy
 mysteries of our religion with contempt; who corrupts manners, and who
 says that when he comes to the last moment of his life, he will have
 to do like others, will confess, and will receive what we call our
 God, but it will only be for the sake of his family."<a name=
 "FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83"
 class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

 <p>All these things had prepared an unfriendly fate for Diderot when
 his time at last came, as it came to most of his friends. For a month
 he was cut off from the outer world. His only company was the
 <i>Paradise Lost</i>, which he happened to have in his pocket at the
 moment of his arrest. He compounded an ink for himself, by scraping
 the slate at the side of his window, grinding it very fine, and mixing
 with wine in a broken glass. A toothpick, found by happy accident in
 the pocket of his waistcoat, served him for pen, and the fly-leaves
 and margins of the Milton made a repository for his thoughts. With a
 simple but very characteristic interest in others who might be as
 unfortunate as himself, he wrote upon the walls of his prison his
 short recipe for writing materials.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id=
 "FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class=
 "fnanchor">[84]</a> Diderot might easily have been buried here for
 months or even years. But, as it happened, the governor of Vincennes
 was a kinsman of Voltaire's divine Emily, the Marquise du Châtelet.
 When Voltaire, who was then at Luneville, heard of Diderot's
 ill-fortune, he proclaimed as usual his detestation of a land where
 bigots can shut up philosophers under lock and key, and as usual he at
 once set to work to lessen the wrong. Madame du Châtelet was made to
 write to the governor, praying him to soften the imprisonment of
 Socrates-Diderot as much as he could.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id=
 "FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class=
 "fnanchor">[85]</a> It was the last of her good deeds, for she died in
 circumstances of grotesque tragedy in the following month (Sept.
 1749), and her husband, her son, Voltaire, and Saint Lambert
 alternately consoled and reproached one another over her grave.
 Diderot meanwhile had the benefit of her intervention. He was
 transferred from the dungeon to the château, was allowed to wander
 about the park on his parole, and to receive visits from his friends.
 One of the most impulsive of these friends was Jean Jacques. Their
 first meeting after Diderot's imprisonment has been, described by
 Rousseau himself, in terms at which the phlegmatic will smile—not
 wisely, for the manner of expressing emotion, like all else, is
 relative. "After three or four centuries of impatience, I flew into
 the arms of my friend. indescribable moment! He, was not alone;
 D'Alembert and the treasurer of the Sainte Chapelle were with him. As
 I went in, I saw no one but himself. With a single hound and a cry, I
 pressed his face close to mine, I clasped him tightly in my arms,
 without speaking to him save by my tears and sobs; I was choking with
 tenderness and joy."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id=
 "FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class=
 "fnanchor">[86]</a> After this Rousseau used to walk over to see him
 two or three times a week. It was during one of these walks on a hot
 summer afternoon, that he first thought of that memorable literary
 effort, the essay against civilisation. He sank down at the foot of a
 tree, and feverishly wrote a page or two to show to his friend. He
 tells us that but for Diderot's encouragement he should hardly have
 executed his design. There is a story that it was Diderot who first
 suggested to Rousseau to affirm that arts and sciences had corrupted
 manners. There is no violent improbability in this. Diderot, for all
 the robustness and penetration of his judgment, was yet often borne by
 his natural impetuosity towards the region of paradox. His own curious
 and bold <i>Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville</i> is entirely in
 the vein of Rousseau's discourse on the superiority of primitive over
 civilised life. "Prodigious sibyl of the eighteenth century," cries
 Michelet, "the mighty magician Diderot! He breathed out one day a
 breath; lo, there sprang up a man—Rousseau."<a name="FNanchor_87_87"
 id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class=
 "fnanchor">[87]</a> It is hard to believe that such an astonishing
 genius for literature as Rousseau's could have lain concealed, after
 he had once inhaled the vivifying air of Paris. Yet the fire and
 inspiring energy of Diderot may well have been the quickening accident
 that brought his genius into productive life. All the testimony goes
 to show that it was so. Whether, however, Diderot is really
 responsible for the perverse direction of Rousseau's argument is a
 question of fact, and the evidence is not decisive.<a name=
 "FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88"
 class="fnanchor">[88]</a> It would be an odd example of that giant's
 nonchalance which is always so amazing in Diderot, if he really
 instigated the most eloquent and passionate writer then alive to
 denounce art and science as the scourge of mankind, at the very moment
 when he was himself straining his whole effort to spread the arts and
 sciences, and to cover them with glory in men's eyes.</p>

 <p>Among Diderot's other visitors was Madame de Puisieux. One day she
 came clad in gay apparel, bound for a merry-making at a neighbouring
 village. Diderot, conceiving jealous doubts of her fidelity, received
 assurance that she would be solitary and companionless at the feast,
 thinking mournfully of her persecuted philosopher lying in prison. She
 forgot that one of the parents of philosophy is curiosity, and that
 Diderot had trained himself in the school of the sceptics. That
 evening he scaled the walls of the park of Vincennes, flew to the
 scene of the festival, and there found what he had expected. In vain
 for her had he written upon virtue and merit, and the unhallowed
 friendship came to an end.</p>

 <p>After three months of captivity, Diderot was released. The
 booksellers who were interested in the Encyclopædia were importunate
 with the authorities to restore its head and chief to an enterprise
 that stirred universal curiosity.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id=
 "FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class=
 "fnanchor">[89]</a> For the first volume of that famous work was now
 almost ready to appear, and expectation was keen. The idea of the book
 had occurred to Diderot in 1745, and from 1745 to 1765 it was the
 absorbing occupation of his life. Of the value and significance of the
 conception underlying this immense operation, I shall speak in the
 next chapter. There also I shall describe its history. The
 circumstances under which these five-and-thirty volumes were given to
 the world mark Diderot for one of the few true heroes of literature.
 They called into play some of the most admirable of human qualities.
 They required a laboriousness as steady and as prolonged, a wariness
 as alert, a grasp of plan as firm, a fortitude as patient, unvarying,
 and unshaken, as men are accustomed to applaud in the engineer who
 constructs some vast and difficult work, or the commander who directs
 a hardy and dangerous expedition.</p>

 <h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />
 THE ENCYCLOPÆDIA.</h2>

 <p>The history of the encyclopædic conception of human knowledge is a
 much more interesting and important object of inquiry than a list of
 the various encyclopædic enterprises to be found in the annals of
 literature. Yet it is proper here to mention some of the attempts in
 this direction, which preceded our memorable book of the eighteenth
 century. It is to Aristotle, no doubt, that we must look for the first
 glimpse of the idea that human knowledge is a totality, whose parts
 are all closely and organically connected with one another. But the
 idea that only dawned in that gigantic understanding was lost for many
 centuries. The compilations of Pliny are not in a right sense
 encyclopædic, being presided over by no definite idea of informing
 order. It was not until the later middle age that any attempt was made
 to present knowledge as a whole. Albertus Magnus, "the ape of
 Aristotle" (1193-1280), left for a season the three great questions of
 the existence of universals, of the modes of the existence of species
 and genus, and of their place in or out of the bosom of the
 individuals, and executed a compilation of such physical facts as had
 been then discovered.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id=
 "FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class=
 "fnanchor">[90]</a> A more distinctly encyclopædic work was the book
 of Vincent de Beauvais (<i>d.</i> 1264), called <i>Speculum naturale,
 morale, doctrinale, et historiale</i>—a compilation from Aquinas in
 some parts, and from Aristotle in others. Hallam mentions three other
 compilations of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and observes
 that their laborious authors did not much improve the materials which
 they had amassed in their studies, though they sometimes arranged them
 conveniently. In the mediæval period, as he remarks, the want of
 capacity to discern probable truths was a very great drawback from the
 value of their compilations.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id=
 "FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class=
 "fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

 <p>Far the most striking production of the thirteenth century in this
 kind was the <i>Opus Majus</i> of Roger Bacon (1267), of which it has
 been said that it is at once the Encyclopædia and the Novum Organum of
 that age;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> at once a summary of
 knowledge, and the suggestion of a truer method. This, however, was
 merely the introductory sketch to a vaster encyclopædic work, the
 <i>Compendium Philosophiæ</i>, which was not perfected. "In common
 with minds of great and comprehensive grasp, his vivid perception of
 the intimate relationship of the different parts of philosophy, and
 his desire to raise himself from the dead level of every individual
 science, induced Bacon to grasp at and embrace the whole."<a name=
 "FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93"
 class="fnanchor">[93]</a> In truth, the encyclopædic spirit was in the
 air throughout the thirteenth century. It was the century of books
 bearing the significant titles of Summa, or Universitas, or
 Speculum.</p>

 <p>The same spirit revived towards the middle of the sixteenth
 century. In 1541 a book was published at Basel by one Ringelberg,
 which first took the name of Cyclopædia, that has since then become so
 familiar a word in Western Europe. This was followed within sixty
 years by several other works of the same kind. The movement reached
 its height in a book which remained the best in its order for a
 century. A German, one J.H. Alsted (1588-1638), published in 1620 an
 <i>Encyclopædia scientiarum omnium</i>. A hundred years later the
 illustrious Leibnitz pronounced it a worthy task to perfect and amend
 Alsted's book. What was wanting to the excellent man, he said, was
 neither labour nor judgment, but material, and the good fortune of
 such days as ours. And Leibnitz wrote a paper of suggestions for its
 extension and improvement.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id=
 "FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class=
 "fnanchor">[94]</a> Alsted's Encyclopædia is of course written in
 Latin, and he prefixes to it by way of motto the celebrated lines in
 which Lucretius declares that nothing is sweeter than to dwell apart
 in the serene temples of the wise. Though he informs us in the preface
 that his object was to trace the outlines of the great "latifundium
 regni philosophici" in a single syntagma, yet he really does no more
 than arrange a number of separate treatises or manuals, and even
 dictionaries, within the limits of a couple of folios. As is natural
 to the spirit of the age in which he wrote, great predominance is
 given to the verbal sciences of grammar, rhetoric, and formal logic,
 and a verbal or logical division regulates the distribution of the
 matter, rather than a scientific regard for its objective
 relations.</p>

 <p>For the true parentage, however, of the Encyclopædia of Diderot and
 D'Alembert, it is unnecessary to prolong this list. It was Francis
 Bacon's idea of the systematic classification of knowledge which
 inspired Diderot, and guided his hand throughout. "If we emerge from
 this vast operation," he wrote in the Prospectus, "our principal debt
 will be to the chancellor Bacon, who sketched the plan of a universal
 dictionary of sciences and arts at a time when there were not, so to
 say, either arts or sciences." This sense of profound and devoted
 obligation was shared by D'Alembert, and was expressed a hundred times
 in the course of the work. No more striking panegyric has ever been
 passed upon our immortal countryman than is to be found in the
 Preliminary Discourse.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id=
 "FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class=
 "fnanchor">[95]</a> The French Encyclopædia was the direct fruit of
 Bacon's magnificent conceptions. And if the efficient origin of the
 Encyclopædia was English, so did the occasion rise in England
 also.</p>

 <p>In 1727 Ephraim Chambers, a Westmoreland Quaker, published in
 London two folios, entitled, a Cyclopædia or Universal Dictionary of
 the Arts and Sciences. The idea of it was broad and excellent. "Our
 view," says Chambers, "was to consider the several matters, not only
 in themselves, but relatively, or as they respect each other; both to
 treat them as so many wholes, and as so many parts of some greater
 whole." The compiler lacked the grasp necessary to realise this
 laudable purpose. The book has, however, the merit of conciseness, and
 is a singular monument of literary industry, for it was entirely
 compiled by Chambers himself. It had a great success, and though its
 price was high (four guineas), it ran through five editions in
 eighteen years. On the whole, however, it is meagre, and more like a
 dictionary than an encyclopædia, such as Alsted's for instance.</p>

 <p>Some fifteen years after the publication of Chambers's Cyclopædia,
 an Englishman (Mills) and a German (Sellius) went to Le Breton with a
 project for its translation into French. The bookseller obtained the
 requisite privilege from the government, but he obtained it for
 himself, and not for the projectors. This trick led to a quarrel, and
 before it was settled the German died and the Englishman returned to
 his own country. They left the translation behind them duly
 executed.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Le Breton then carried the
 undertaking to a certain abbé, Gua de Malves. Gua de Malves (<i>b.</i>
 1712) seems to have been a man of a busy and ingenious mind. He was
 the translator of Berkeley's <i>Hylas and Philonous</i>, of Anson's
 Voyages, and of various English tracts on currency and political
 economy. It is said that he first suggested the idea of a cyclopædia
 on a fuller plan,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id=
 "FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class=
 "fnanchor">[97]</a> but we have no evidence of this. In any case, the
 project made no advance in his hands. The embarrassed bookseller next
 applied to Diderot, who was then much in need of work that should
 bring him bread. His fertile and energetic intelligence transformed
 the scheme. By an admirable intuition, he divined the opportunity
 which would be given by the encyclopædic form, of gathering up into a
 whole all that new thought and modern knowledge, which existed as yet
 in unsystematic and uninterpreted fragments. His enthusiasm fired Le
 Breton. It was resolved to make Chambers's work a mere starting-point
 for a new enterprise of far wider scope.</p>

 <p>"The old and learned D'Aguesseau," says Michelet, "notwithstanding
 the pitiable, the wretched sides of his character, had two lofty
 sides, his reform of the laws, and a personal passion, the taste and
 urgent need of universality, a certain encyclopædic sense. A young man
 came to him one day, a man of letters living by his pen, and somewhat
 under a cloud for one or two hazardous books that lack of bread had
 driven him to write. Yet this stranger of dubious repute wrought a
 miracle. With bewilderment the old sage listened to him unrolling the
 gigantic scheme of a book that should be all books. On his lips,
 sciences were light and life. It was more than speech, it was
 creation. One would have said that he had made these sciences, and was
 still at work, adding, extending, fertilising, ever engendering. The
 effect was incredible. D'Aguesseau, a moment above himself, forgot the
 old man, received the infection of genius, and became great with the
 greatness of the other. He had faith in the young man, and protected
 the Encyclopædia."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id=
 "FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class=
 "fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

 <p>A fresh privilege was procured (Jan. 21, 1746), and as Le Breton's
 capital was insufficient for a project of this magnitude, he invited
 three other booksellers to join him, retaining a half share for
 himself, and allotting the other moiety to them. As Le Breton was not
 strong enough to bear the material burdens of producing a work on so
 gigantic a scale as was now proposed, so Diderot felt himself unequal
 to the task of arranging and supervising every department of a book
 that was to include the whole circle of the sciences. He was not
 skilled enough in mathematics, nor in physics, which were then for the
 most part mathematically conceived. For that province, he associated
 with himself as an editorial colleague one of the most conspicuous and
 active members of the philosophical party. Of this eminent man, whose
 relations with Diderot were for some years so intimate, it is proper
 that we should say something.</p>

 <p>D'Alembert was the natural son of Madame de Tencin, by whom he had
 been barbarously exposed immediately after his birth. "The true
 ancestors of a man of genius," says Condorcet finely upon this
 circumstance, "are the masters who have gone before him, and his true
 descendants are disciples that are worthy of him." He was discovered
 on a November night in the year 1717, by the beadle, in a nearly dying
 condition on the steps of the church of St. John the Round, from which
 he afterwards took his Christian name. An honest woman of the common
 people, with that personal devotion which is less rare among the poor
 than among the rich, took charge of the foundling. The father, who was
 an officer of artillery and brother of Destouches, the author of some
 poor comedies, by and by advanced the small sums required to pay for
 the boy's schooling. D'Alembert proved a brilliant student. Unlike
 nearly every other member of the encyclopædic party, he was a pupil
 not of the Jesuits but of their rivals. The Jansenists recognised the
 keenness and force of their pupil, and hoped that they had discovered
 a new Pascal. But he was less docile than his great predecessor in
 their ranks. When his studies were completed, he devoted himself to
 geometry, for which he had a passion that nothing could extinguish.
 For the old monastic vow of poverty, chastity, and obedience, he
 adopted the manlier substitute of poverty, truth, and liberty—the
 worthy device of every man of letters. When he awoke in the morning,
 he thought with delight of the work that had been begun the previous
 day and would occupy the day before him. In the necessary intervals of
 his meditations, he recalled the lively pleasure that he felt at the
 play: at the play between the acts, he thought of the still greater
 pleasure that was promised to him by the work of the morrow. His
 mathematical labours led to valuable results in the principles of
 equilibrium and the movement of fluids, in a new calculus, and in a
 new solution of the problem of the precession of the
 equinoxes.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

 <p>These contributions to what was then the most popular of the
 sciences brought him fame, and fame brought him its usual
 distractions. As soon as a writer has shown himself the possessor of
 gifts that may be of value to society, then society straightway sets
 to work to seduce and hinder him from diligently exercising them.
 D'Alembert resisted these influences steadfastly. His means were very
 limited, yet he could never be induced to increase them at the cost
 either of his social independence or of his scientific pursuits. He
 lived for forty years under the humble roof of the poor woman who had
 treated him as a son. "You will never be anything better than a
 philosopher," she used to cry reproachfully, "and what is a
 philosopher? 'Tis a madman who torments himself all his life, that
 people may talk about him when he is dead." D'Alembert zealously
 adhered to his destination. Frederick the Great vainly tempted him by
 an offer of the succession to Maupertuis as president of the Academy
 of Berlin. Although, however, he declined to accept the post, he
 enjoyed all its authority and prerogative. Frederick always consulted
 him in filling up vacancies and making appointments. It is a
 magnanimous trait in D'Alembert's history that he should have procured
 for Lagrange a position and livelihood at Berlin, warmly commending
 him as a man of rare and superior genius, although Lagrange had
 vigorously opposed some of his own mathematical theories. Ten years
 after Frederick's offer, the other great potentate of the north,
 Catherine of Russia, besought him to undertake the education of the
 young grand duke, her son. But neither urgent flatteries and
 solicitations under the imperial hand, nor the munificent offer of a
 hundred thousand francs a year, availed to draw him away from his
 independence and his friends. The great Frederick used to compare him
 to one of those oriental monarchs, who cherish a strict seclusion in
 order to enhance their importance and majesty. He did not refuse a
 pension of some fifty pounds a year from Berlin, and the same amount
 was bestowed upon him from the privy purse at Versailles. He received
 a small annual sum in addition from the Academy.</p>

 <p>Though the mathematical sciences remained the objects of his
 special study, D'Alembert was as free as the other great men of the
 encyclopædic school from the narrowness of the pure specialist. He
 naturally reminds us of the remarkable saying imputed to Leibnitz,
 that he only attributed importance to science, because it enabled him
 to speak with authority in philosophy and religion. His correspondence
 with Voltaire, extending over the third quarter of the century, is the
 most instructive record that we possess of the many-sided doings of
 that busy time. His series of <i>éloges</i> on the academicians who
 died between 1700 and 1772 is one of the most interesting works in the
 department of literary history. He paid the keenest attention to the
 great and difficult art of writing. Translations from Tacitus, Bacon,
 and Addison, show his industry in a useful practice. A long collection
 of synonyms bears witness to his fine discrimination in the use of
 words. And the clearness, precision, and reserved energy of his own
 prose mark the success of the pains that he took with style. He knew
 the secret. Have lofty sentiments, he said, and your manner of writing
 will be firm and noble.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id=
 "FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class=
 "fnanchor">[100]</a> Yet he did not ignore the other side and half of
 the truth, which is expressed in the saying of another important
 writer of that day—By taking trouble to speak with precision, one
 gains the habit of thinking rightly (<i>Condillac</i>).</p>

 <p>Like so many others to whom literature owes much, D'Alembert was
 all his life fighting against bad health. Like Voltaire and Rousseau,
 he was born dying, and he remained delicate and valetudinarian to the
 end. He had the mental infirmities belonging to his temperament. He
 was restless, impatient, mobile, susceptible of irritation. When the
 young Mademoiselle Phlipon, in after years famous as wife of the
 virtuous Roland, was taken to a sitting of the Academy, she was
 curious to see the author of the Preliminary Discourse to the
 Encyclopædia, but his small face and sharp thin voice made her reflect
 with some disappointment, that the writings of a philosopher are
 better to know than his mask.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id=
 "FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class=
 "fnanchor">[101]</a> In everything except zeal for light and
 emancipation, D'Alembert was the opposite of Diderot. Where Diderot
 was exuberant, prodigal, and disordered, D'Alembert was a precisian.
 Difference of temperament, however, did not prevent their friendship
 from being for many years cordial and intimate. When the Encyclopædia
 was planned, it was to D'Alembert, as we have said, that Diderot
 turned for aid in the mathematical sciences, where his own knowledge
 was not sufficiently full nor well grounded. They were in strong and
 singular agreement in their idea of the proper place and function of
 the man of letters. One of the most striking facts about their
 alliance, and one of the most important facts in the history of the
 Encyclopædia, is that henceforth the profession of letters became at
 once definite and independent. Diderot and D'Alembert both of them
 remained poor, but they were never hangers-on. They did not look to
 patrons, nor did they bound their vision by Versailles. They were the
 first to assert the lawful authority of the new priesthood. They
 revolted deliberately and in set form against the old system of
 suitorship and protection. "Happy are men of letters," wrote
 D'Alembert, "if they recognise at last that the surest way of making
 themselves respectable is to live united and almost shut up among
 themselves; that by this union they will come, without any trouble, to
 give the law to the rest of the nation in all affairs of taste and
 philosophy; that the true esteem is that which is awarded by men who
 are themselves worthy of esteem.... As if the art of instructing and
 enlightening men were not, after the too rare art of good government,
 the noblest portion and gift in human reach."<a name=
 "FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

 <p>This consciousness of the power and exaltation of their calling,
 which men of letters now acquired, is much more than the superficial
 fact which it may at first seem to be. It marked the rise of a new
 teaching order and the supersession of the old. The highest moral
 ideas now belonged no longer to the clergy, but to the writers; no
 longer to official Catholicism, but to that fertilising medley of new
 notions about human knowledge and human society which then went by the
 name of philosophy. What is striking is that the ideas sown by
 philosophy became eventually the source of higher life in Catholicism.
 If the church of the revolution showed something that we may justly
 admire, it was because the encyclopædic band had involuntarily and
 inevitably imparted a measure of their own clearsightedness,
 fortitude, moral energy, and spirit of social improvement, to a church
 which was, when they began their work, an abominable burden on the
 spiritual life of the nation. If the Catholicism of Chateaubriand, of
 Lamennais, of Montalembert, was a different thing from the Catholicism
 of a Dubois, or a Rohan, from the vile corruptions of the Jesuits and
 the grovelling superstitions of the later Jansenists, it was the
 execrated freethinkers whom the church and mankind had to thank for
 the change. The most enlightened Catholic of to-day ought to admit
 that Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau, were the true reformers of his
 creed. They supplied it with ideas which saved it from becoming
 finally a curse to civilisation. It was no Christian prelate, but
 Diderot who burst the bonds of a paralysing dogma by the magnificent
 cry, <i>Détruisez ces enceintes qui rétrécissent vos idées! Elargissez
 Dieu!</i><a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> We see the same
 phenomenon in our own day. The Christian churches are assimilating as
 rapidly as their formula will permit, the new light and the more
 generous moral ideas and the higher spirituality of teachers who have
 abandoned all churches, and who are systematically denounced as
 enemies of the souls of men. <i>Sic vos non vobis mellificatis
 apes!</i> These transformations of religion by leavening elements
 contributed from a foreign doctrine, are the most interesting process
 in the history of truth.</p>

 <p>The Encyclopædia became a powerful engine for aiding such a
 transformation. Because it was this, and because it rallied all that
 was then best in France round the standard of light and social hope,
 we ought hardly to grudge time or pains to its history. For it was not
 merely in the field of religious ideas that the Encyclopædists led
 France in a new way. They affected the national life on every side,
 pressing forward with enlightened principles in all the branches of
 material and political organisation. Their union in a great
 philosophical band gave an impressive significance to their work. The
 collection within a single set of volumes of a body of new truths,
 relating to so many of the main interests of men, invested the book
 and its writers with an aspect of universality, of collective and
 organic doctrine, which the writers themselves would without doubt
 have disowned, and which it is easy to dissolve by tests of logic. But
 the popular impression that the Encyclopædists constituted a single
 body with a common doctrine and a common aim was practically sound.
 Comte has pointed out with admirable clearness the merit of the
 conception of an encyclopædic workshop.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id=
 "FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class=
 "fnanchor">[104]</a> It united the members of rival destructive
 schools in a great constructive task. It furnished a rallying-point
 for efforts otherwise the most divergent. Their influence was
 precisely what it would have been, if popular impressions had been
 literally true. Diderot and D'Alembert did their best to heighten this
 feeling. They missed no occasion of fixing a sentiment of co-operation
 and fellowship. They spoke of their dictionary as the transactions of
 an Academy.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id=
 "FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class=
 "fnanchor">[105]</a> Each writer was answerable for his own
 contribution, but he was in the position of a member of some learned
 corporation. To every volume, until the great crisis of 1759, was
 prefixed a list of those who had contributed to it. If a colleague
 died, the public was informed of the loss that the work had sustained,
 and his services were worthily commemorated in a formal
 <i>éloge</i>.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id=
 "FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class=
 "fnanchor">[106]</a> Feuds, epigrams, and offences were not absent,
 but on the whole there was steadfast and generous fraternity.</p>

 <p>As Voltaire eloquently said, officers of war by land and by sea,
 magistrates, physicians who knew nature, men of letters whose taste
 purified knowledge, geometers, physicists, all united in a work that
 was as useful as it was laborious, without any view of interest,
 without even seeking fame, as many of them concealed their names;
 finally without any common understanding and agreement, and therefore
 without anything of the spirit of party.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id=
 "FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class=
 "fnanchor">[107]</a> Turning over the pages on which the list of
 writers is inscribed, we find in one place or another nearly every
 name that has helped to make the literature of the time famous.
 Montesquieu, who died in the beginning of 1755, left behind him the
 unfinished fragment of an article on Taste, and it may be noticed in
 passing that our good-natured Diderot was the only man of letters who
 attended the remains of the illustrious writer to the grave.<a name=
 "FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The article itself,
 though no more than a fragment, has all the charms of Montesquieu's
 delightful style; it is serious without pedantry, graceful without
 levity, and is rich in observations that are precise and pointed
 without the vice of emphasis. The great Turgot, diligently solicitous
 for the success of every enterprise that promised to improve human
 happiness by adding to knowledge and spreading enlightenment, wrote
 some of the most valuable articles that the work contained, and his
 discussion of Endowments perhaps still remains the weightiest
 contribution to that important subject. Oddly enough, he was one of
 the very few writers who refused to sign his name to his
 contributions.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id=
 "FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class=
 "fnanchor">[109]</a> His assistance only ceased when he perceived that
 the scheme was being coloured by that spirit of sect, which he always
 counted the worst enemy of the spirit of truth.<a name=
 "FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Jean Jacques Rousseau,
 who had just won a singular reputation by his paradoxes on natural
 equality and the corruptions of civilisation, furnished the articles
 on music in the first half dozen volumes. They were not free from
 mistakes, but his colleagues chivalrously defended him by the plea of
 careless printing or indifferent copying.<a name="FNanchor_111_111"
 id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class=
 "fnanchor">[111]</a> The stately Buffon very early in the history of
 the Encyclopædia sent them an article upon Nature, and the editors
 made haste to announce to their subscribers the advent of so superb a
 colleague.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id=
 "FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class=
 "fnanchor">[112]</a> The articles on natural history, however, were
 left by Buffon in his usual majestic fashion to his faithful
 lieutenant and squire-at-arms, Daubenton. And even his own article
 seems not to have been printed. Before the eleventh volume appeared,
 terrible storms had arisen, not a few of the shipmen had parted
 company, and Buffon may well have been one of them. Certainly the
 article on Nature, as it stands, can hardly be his.</p>

 <p>In the supplementary volumes, which appeared in 1776—ten years
 after the completion of the original undertaking—two new labourers
 came into the vineyard, whose names add fresh lustre and give still
 more serious value to the work. One of these was the prince of the
 physiologists of the eighteenth century, the great Haller, who
 contributed an elaborate history of those who had been his
 predecessors in unfolding the intricate mechanism of the human frame,
 and analysing its marvels of complex function. The other was the
 austere and generous Condorcet. Ever loyal to good causes, and
 resolute against despairing of the human commonwealth, he began in the
 pages of the Encyclopædia a career that was brilliant with good
 promise and high hopes, and ended in the grim hall of the Convention
 and a nobly tragic death amid the red storm of the Terror.</p>

 <p>Among the lesser stars in the encyclopædic firmament are some whose
 names ought not to be wholly omitted. Forbonnais, one of the most
 instructive economic writers of the century, contributed articles to
 the early volumes, which were afterwards republished in his Elements
 of Commerce.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id=
 "FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class=
 "fnanchor">[113]</a> The light-hearted Marmontel wrote cheerful
 articles on Comedy, Eloges, Eclogues, Glory, and other matters of
 literature and taste. Quesnai, the eminent founder of the economic
 sect, dealt with two agricultural subjects, and reproduced both his
 theoretical paradoxes, and his admirable practical maxims, on the
 material prosperity of nations. Holbach, not yet author of the
 memorable System of Nature, compiled a vast number of the articles on
 chemistry and mineralogy, chiefly and avowedly from German sources, he
 being the only writer of the band with a mastery of a language which
 was at that moment hardly more essential to culture than Russian is
 now. The name of Duclos should not be passed over, in the list of the
 foremost men who helped to raise the encyclopædic monument. He was one
 of the shrewdest and most vigorous intelligences of the time, being in
 the front rank of men of the second order. His quality was coarse, but
 this was only the effect of a thoroughly penetrating and masculine
 understanding. His articles in the Encyclopædia (<i>Déclamation des
 Anciens</i>, <i>Etiquette</i>, etc.) are not very remarkable; but the
 reflections on conduct which he styled <i>Considérations sur les Mœurs
 de ce Siécle</i> (1750), though rather hard in tone, abound in an
 acuteness, a breadth, a soundness of perception that entitle the book
 to the rare distinction, among the writings of moralists and social
 observers, of still being worth reading. Morellet wrote upon some of
 the subjects of theology, and his contributions are remarkable as
 being the chief examples in the record of the encyclopædic body of a
 distinctly and deliberately historic treatment of religion. "I let
 people see," he wrote many years after, "that in such a collection as
 the Encyclopædia we ought to treat the history and experience of the
 dogmas and discipline of the Christian, exactly like those of the
 religion of Brahma or Mahomet."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id=
 "FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class=
 "fnanchor">[114]</a> This sage and philosophic principle enabled him
 to write the article, Fils de Dieu (vol. vi.), without sliding into
 Arian, Nestorian, Socinian, or other heretical view on that fantastic
 theme. We need not linger over the names of other writers, who indeed
 are now little more than mere shadows of names, such as La Condamine,
 a scientific traveller of fame and merit in his day and generation; of
 Du Marsais, the poverty-stricken and unlucky scholar who wrote
 articles on grammar; of the President Des Brosses, who was unfortunate
 enough to be in the right in a quarrel about money with Voltaire, and
 who has since been better known to readers through the fury of the
 provoked patriarch, than through his own meritorious contributions to
 the early history of civilisation.</p>

 <p>The name of one faithful worker in the building of this new
 Jerusalem ought not to be omitted, though his writings were <i>multa
 non multum</i>. The Chevalier de Jaucourt (1704-1779), as his title
 shows, was the younger son of a noble house. He studied at Geneva,
 Cambridge, and Leyden, and published in 1734 a useful account of the
 life and writings of Leibnitz. When the Encyclopædia was projected,
 his services were at once secured, and he became its slave from the
 beginning of A to the end of Z. He wrote articles in his own special
 subjects of natural history and physical science, but he was always
 ready to lend his help in other departments, in writing, rewriting,
 reading, correcting, and all those other humbler necessities of
 editorship of which the inconsiderate reader knows little and thinks
 less. Jaucourt revelled in this drudgery. God made him for grinding
 articles, said Diderot. For six or seven years, he wrote one day,
 Jaucourt has been in the middle of half a dozen secretaries, reading,
 dictating, slaving, for thirteen or fourteen hours a day, and he is
 not tired of it even now. When he was told that the work must
 positively be brought to an end, his countenance fell, and the
 prospect of release from such happy bondage filled his heart with
 desolation.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id=
 "FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class=
 "fnanchor">[115]</a> "If," says Diderot in the preface to the eighth
 volume (1765), "we have raised a shout of joy like the sailor when he
 espies land after a sombre night that has kept him midway between sky
 and flood, it is to M. de Jaucourt that we are indebted for it. What
 has he not done for us, especially in these latter times? With what
 constancy has he not refused all the solicitations, whether of
 friendship or of authority, that sought to take him away from us?
 Never has sacrifice of repose, of health, of interest been more
 absolute and more entire."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id=
 "FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class=
 "fnanchor">[116]</a> These modest and unwearying helpers in good works
 ought not to be wholly forgotten, in a commemoration of more
 far-shining names.</p>

 <p>Besides those who were known to the conductors of the Encyclopædia,
 was a host of unsought volunteers. "The further we proceed," the
 editors announced in the preface to the sixth volume (1756), "the more
 are we sensible of the increase both in matter and in number of those
 who are good enough to second our efforts." They received many
 articles on the same subject. They were constantly embarrassed by an
 emulation which, however flattering as a testimony to their work,
 obliged them to make a difficult choice, or to lose a good article, or
 to sacrifice one of their regular contributors, or to offend some
 influential newcomer. Every one who had a new idea in his head, or
 what he thought a new idea, sent them an article upon it. Men who were
 priests or pastors by profession and unbelievers in their hearts, sent
 them sheaves of articles in which they permitted themselves the
 delicious luxury of saying a little of what they thought. Women, too,
 pressed into the great work. Unknown ladies volunteered sprightly
 explanations of the technicalities of costume, from the falbala which
 adorned the bottom of their skirts, up to that little knot of riband
 in the hair, which had come to replace the old appalling edifice of
 ten stories high, in hierarchic succession of duchess, solitary,
 musketeer, crescent, firmament, tenth heaven, and mouse.<a name=
 "FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The oldest contributor
 was Lenglet du Fresnoy, whose book on the Method of Studying History
 is still known to those who have examined the development of men's
 ideas about the relations of the present to the past. Lenglet was born
 in 1674. The youngest of the band was Condorcet, who was born nearly
 seventy years later (1743). One veteran, Morellet, who had been, the
 schoolmate of Turgot and Loménie de Brienne, lived to think of many
 things more urgent than Faith, Fils de Dieu, and Fundamentals. He
 survived the Revolution, the Terror, the Empire, Waterloo, the
 Restoration, and died in 1819, within sight of the Holy Alliance and
 the Peterloo massacre. From the birth of Lenglet to the death of
 Morellet—what an arc of the circle of western experience!</p>

 <p>No one will ask whether the keen eye, and stimulating word, and
 helpful hand of Voltaire were wanting to an enterprise which was to
 awaken men to new love of tolerance, enlightenment, charity, and
 justice. Voltaire was playing the refractory courtier at Potsdam when
 the first two volumes appeared. With characteristic vehemence, he
 instantly pronounced it a work which should be the glory of France,
 and the shame of its persecutors. Diderot and D'Alembert were raising
 an immortal edifice, and he would gladly furnish them with a little
 stone here or there, which they might find convenient to stuff into
 some corner or crevice in the wall. He was incessant in his industry.
 Unlike those feebler and more consequential spirits, the
 <i>petits-maîtres</i> of thought, by whom editors are harassed and
 hindered, this great writer was as willing to undertake small subjects
 as large ones, and to submit to all the mutilations and modifications
 which the exigencies of the work and the difficulties of its
 conductors recommended to them.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id=
 "FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class=
 "fnanchor">[118]</a> As the structure progresses, his enthusiasm waxes
 warmer. Diderot and his colleague are cutting their wings for a flight
 to posterity. They are Atlas and Hercules bearing a world upon their
 shoulders. It is the greatest work in the world; it is a superb
 pyramid; its printing-office is the office for the instruction of the
 human race; and so forth, in every phrase of stimulating sympathy and
 energetic interest. Nor does his sympathy blind him to faults of
 execution. Voltaire's good sense and sound judgment were as much at
 the service of his friends in warning them of shortcomings, as in
 eulogising what they achieved. And he had good faith enough to
 complain to his friends, instead of complaining of them. In one place
 he tells them, what is perfectly true, that their journeymen are far
 too declamatory, and too much addicted to substitute vague and puerile
 dissertations for that solid instruction which is what the reader of
 an Encyclopædia seeks. In another he remonstrates against certain
 frivolous affectations, and some of the coxcombries of literary
 modishness. Everywhere he recommends them to insist on a firm and
 distinct method in their contributors—etymologies, definitions,
 examples, reasons, clearness, brevity. "You are badly seconded," he
 writes; "there are bad soldiers in the army of a great
 general."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> "I am sorry to see that
 the writer of the article <i>Hell</i> declares that hell was a point
 in the doctrine of Moses; now by all the devils that is not true. Why
 lie about it? Hell is an excellent thing, to be sure, but it is
 evident that Moses did not know it. 'Tis this world that is
 hell."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

 <p>D'Alembert in reply always admitted the blemishes for which the
 patriarch and master reproached them, but urged various pleas in
 extenuation. He explains that Diderot is not always the master, either
 to reject or to prune the articles that are offered to him.<a name=
 "FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> A writer who happened
 to be useful for many excellent articles would insist as the price of
 good work that they should find room for his bad work also; and so
 forth. "No doubt we have bad articles in theology and metaphysics, but
 with theologians for censors, and a privilege, I defy you to make them
 any better. There are other articles that are less exposed to the
 daylight, and in them all is repaired. Time will enable people to
 distinguish what we have thought from what we have said."<a name=
 "FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> This last is a bitter
 and humiliating word, but before any man hastens to cast a stone, let
 him first make sure that his own life is free from every trace of
 hypocritical conformity and mendacious compliance. Condorcet seems to
 make the only remark that is worth making, when he says that the true
 shame and disgrace of these dissemblings lay not with the writers,
 whose only other alternative was to leave the stagnation of opinion
 undisturbed, but with the ecclesiastics and ministers whose tyranny
 made dissimulation necessary. And the veil imposed by authority did
 not really serve any purpose of concealment. Every reader was let into
 the secret of the writer's true opinion of the old mysteries, by means
 of a piquant phrase, an adroit parallel, a significant reference, an
 equivocal word of dubious panegyric. Diderot openly explains this in
 the pages of the Encyclopædia itself. "In all cases," he says, "where
 a national prejudice would seem to deserve respect, the particular
 article ought to set it respectfully forth, with its whole procession
 of attractions and probabilities. But the edifice of mud ought to be
 overthrown and an unprofitable heap of dust scattered to the wind, by
 references to articles in which solid principles serve as a base for
 the opposite truths. This way of undeceiving men operates promptly on
 minds of the right stamp, and it operates infallibly and without any
 troublesome consequences, secretly and without disturbance, on minds
 of every description."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id=

 <p>It is one of the most deplorable things in the history of
 literature to see a man endowed with Diderot's generous conceptions
 and high social aims, forced to stoop to these odious economies. In
 reading his Prospectus, and still more directly in his article,</p>

 <p><i>Encyclopédie</i>, we are struck by the beneficence and breadth
 of the great designs which inspire and support him. The Encyclopædia,
 it has been said, was no peaceful storehouse in which scholars and
 thinkers of all kinds could survey the riches they had acquired; it
 was a gigantic siege-engine and armoury of weapons of attack.<a name=
 "FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> This is only true in a
 limited sense of one part of the work, and that not the most important
 part. Such a judgment is only possible for one who has not studied the
 book itself, or else who is ignorant of the social requirements of
 France at the time. We shall show this presently in detail. Meanwhile
 it is enough to make two observations. The implements which the
 circumstances of the time made it necessary to use as weapons of
 attack, were equally fitted for the acquisition in a happier season of
 those treasures of thought and knowledge which are the object of
 disinterested research. And what is still more important, we have to
 observe that it was the characteristic note and signal glory of the
 French revolutionary school, to subordinate mere knowledge to the
 practical work of raising society up from the corruption and paralysis
 to which it had been brought by the double action of civil and
 ecclesiastical authority. The efforts of the Encyclopædists were not
 disinterested in the sense of being vague blows in the air. Their aim
 was not theory but practice, not literature but life. The
 Encyclopædists were no doubt all men of battle, and some of them were
 hardly more than mere partisans.</p>

 <p>But Diderot at least had constantly in mind the great work which
 remained after the battle should be won. He was profoundly conscious
 that the mere accumulation of knowledge of the directly physical facts
 of the universe would take men a very short way towards
 reconstruction. And he struck the key-note in such admirable passages
 as this: "One consideration especially that we ought never to lose
 from sight is that, if we ever banish a man, or the thinking and
 contemplative being, from above the surface of the earth, this
 pathetic and sublime spectacle of nature becomes no more than a scene
 of melancholy and silence. The universe is dumb; the darkness and
 silence of the night take possession of it ...It is the presence of
 man that gives its interest to the existence of other beings; and what
 better object can we set before ourselves in the history of these
 beings, than to accept such a consideration? Why shall we not
 introduce man into our work in the same place which he holds in the
 universe? Why shall we not make him a common centre? Is there in
 infinite space any other point from which we can with greater
 advantage draw those immense lines that we propose to extend to all
 other points? What a vivid and softening reaction must result between
 man and the beings by whom he is surrounded ...Man is the single term
 from which we ought to set out, and to which we ought to trace all
 back, if we would please, interest, touch, even in the most arid
 reflections and the driest details. If you take away my own existence
 and the happiness of my fellows, of what concern to me is all the rest
 of nature.'<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id=
 "FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class=
 "fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

 <p>In this we hear the voice of the new time, as we do in his
 exclamation that the perfection of an Encyclopædia is the work of
 centuries; centuries had to elapse before the foundations could be
 laid; centuries would have to elapse before its completion: "<i>mais à
 la posérité, et</i> À L'ÊTRE QUI NE MEURT POINT!"<a name=
 "FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> These exalted ideas
 were not a substitute for arduous labour. In all that Diderot writes
 upon his magnificent undertaking, we are struck by his singular union
 of common sense with elevation, of simplicity with grasp, of
 suppleness with strength, of modesty with hopeful confidence. On
 occasions that would have tempted a man of less sincerity and less
 seriousness to bombast and inflation, his sense of the unavoidable
 imperfections of so vast a work always makes itself felt through his
 pride in its lofty aim and beneficent design. The weight of the burden
 steadied him, and the anxiety of the honest and laborious craftsman
 mastered the impulses of rhetoric.</p>

 <p>Before going further into the general contents of the Encyclopædia,
 we shall briefly describe the extraordinary succession of obstacles
 and embarrassments against which its intrepid conductor was compelled
 to fight his way. The project was fully conceived and its details
 worked out between 1745 and 1748. The Encyclopedia was announced in
 1750, in a Prospectus of which Diderot was the author. At length in
 1751 the first volume of the work itself was given to the public,
 followed by the second in January 1752. The clerical party at once
 discerned what tremendous fortifications, with how deadly an armament,
 were rising up in face of their camp. The Jesuits had always been
 jealous of an enterprise in which they had not been invited to take a
 part. They had expected at least to have the control of the articles
 on theology. They now were bent on taking the work into their own
 hands, and orthodoxy hastily set all the machinery of its ally,
 authority, in vigorous motion.</p>

 <p>The first attack was indirect. An abbé de Prades sustained a
 certain thesis in an official exercise at the Sorbonne, and Diderot
 was suspected, without good reason, of being its true author. An
 examination of its propositions was ordered. It was pronounced
 pernicious, dangerous, and tending to deism, chiefly on account of
 some too suggestive comparisons between the miraculous healings in the
 New Testament, and those ascribed in the more ancient legend to
 Æsculapius. Other grounds of vehement objection were found in the
 writer's maintenance of the Lockian theory of the origin of our ideas.
 To deny the innateness of ideas was roundly asserted to be materialism
 and atheism. The abbé de Prades was condemned, and deprived of his
 license (Jan 27, 1752). As he was known to be a friend of Diderot, and
 was suspected of being the writer of articles on theology in the
 Encyclopædia, the design of the Jesuit cabal in ruining De Prades was
 to discredit the new undertaking, and to induce the government to
 prohibit it. Their next step was to procure a pastoral from the
 archbishop of Paris. This document not only condemned the heretical
 propositions of De Prades, but referred in sombre terms to unnamed
 works teeming with error and impiety. Every one understood the
 reference, and among its effects was an extension of the vogue and
 notoriety of the Encyclopædia.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id=

 "fnanchor">[128]</a> The Jesuits were not allowed to retain a monopoly
 of persecuting zeal, and the Jansenists refused to be left behind in
 the race of hypocritical intrigue. The bishop of Auxerre, who belonged
 to this party, followed his brother prelate of Paris in a more direct
 attack, in which he included not only the Encyclopædia, but
 Montesquieu and Buffon. De Prades took to flight. D'Alembert commended
 him to Voltaire, then at Berlin. The king was absent, but Voltaire
 gave royal protection to the fugitive until Frederick's return. De
 Prades was then at once taken into favour and appointed reader to the
 king. He proved but a poor martyr, however, for he afterwards
 retracted his heresies, got a benefice, and was put into prison by
 Frederick for giving information to his French countrymen during the
 Seven Years' War.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id=

 "fnanchor">[129]</a> Unfortunately neither orthodoxy nor heterodoxy
 has any exclusive patent for monopoly of rascals.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile Diderot wrote on his behalf an energetic and dignified
 reply to the aggressive pastoral. This apology is not such a
 masterpiece of eloquence as the magnificent letter addressed by
 Rousseau ten years later to the archbishop of Paris, after the
 pastoral against Emilius. But Diderot's vindication of De Prades is
 firm, moderate, and closely argumentative. The piece is worth turning
 to in our own day, when great dignitaries of the churches too often
 show the same ignorance, the same temerity, and the same reckless want
 of charity, as the bishop of Auxerre showed a hundred and twenty years
 ago. They resort to the very same fallacies by way of shield against
 scientific truths or philosophical speculations that happen not to be
 easily reconcilable with their official opinions. "I know nothing so
 indecent," says Diderot, "and nothing so injurious to religion as
 these vague declamations of theologians against reason. One would
 suppose, to hear them, that men could only enter into the bosom of
 Christianity as a herd of cattle enter into a stable; and that we must
 renounce our common sense either to embrace our religion or to remain
 in it ...Such principles as yours are made to frighten small souls;
 everything alarms them, because they perceive clearly the consequences
 of nothing; they set up connections among things which have nothing to
 do with one another; they spy danger in any method of arguing which is
 strange to them; they float at hazard between truths and prejudices
 which they never distinguish, and to which they are equally attached;
 and all their life is passed in crying out either miracle or impiety."
 In an eloquent peroration, which is not more eloquent than it is
 instructive, De Prades is made to turn round on his Jansenist censor,
 and reproach him with the disturbance with which the intestine
 rivalries of Jansenist and Jesuit had afflicted the faithful. "It is
 the abominable testimony of your convulsions," he cries, "that has
 overthrown the testimony of miracles. It is the fatuous audacity with
 which your fanatics have confronted persecution, that has annihilated
 the evidence of the martyrs. It is your declamations against sovereign
 pontiffs, against bishops, against all the orders of the
 ecclesiastical hierarchy, that have covered priest, altar, and creed
 with opprobrium. If the pope, the bishops, the priests, the simple
 faithful, the whole church, if its mysteries, its sacraments, its
 temples, its ceremonies, have fallen into contempt, yours, yours, is
 the handiwork."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id=

 <p>Bourdaloue more than half a century before had taunted the
 free-thinkers of his day with falseness and inconsistency in taking
 sides with the Jansenists, whose superstitions they notoriously held
 in open contempt. The motive for the alliance was tolerably obvious.
 The Jansenists, apart from their theology, were above all else the
 representatives of opposition to authority. It was for this that Lewis
 XIV. counted them worse than atheists. The Jesuits, it has been well
 said in keeping down their enemies by force, became the partisans of
 absolute government, and upheld it on every occasion. The Jansenists,
 after they had been crushed by violence, began to feel to what
 excesses power might be brought. From being speculative enemies to
 freedom as a theory, they became, through the education of
 persecution, the partisans of freedom in practice. The quarrel of
 Molinists and Jansenists, from a question of theology, grew into a
 question of human liberty.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id=
 "FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class=
 "fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

 <p>Circumstances had now changed. The free-thinkers were becoming
 strong enough to represent opposition to authority on their own
 principles and in their own persons. Diderot's vigorous remonstrance
 with the bishop of Auxerre incidentally marks for us the definite
 rupture of philosophic sympathy for the Jansenist champions. "It is
 your disputatiousness," he said, "which within the last forty years
 has made far more unbelievers than all the productions of philosophy."
 As we cannot too clearly realise, it was the flagrant social
 incompetence of the church which brought what they called Philosophy,
 that is to say Liberalism, into vogue and power. Locke's Essay had
 been translated in 1700, but it had made no mark, and as late as 1725
 the first edition of the translation remained unsold. It was the
 weakness and unsightly decrepitude of the ecclesiastics which opened
 the way for the thinkers.</p>

 <p>This victory, however, was not yet. Diderot had still a dismal
 wilderness to traverse. He was not without secret friends even in the
 camp of his enemies.</p>

 <p>After his reply to Peré Berthier's attack on the Prospectus, he
 received an anonymous letter to the effect that if he wished to avenge
 himself on the Jesuits, there were both important documents and money
 at his command. Diderot replied that he was in no want of money, and
 that he had no time to spare for Jesuit documents.<a name=
 "FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> He trusted to reason.
 Neither reason nor eloquence availed against the credit at court of
 the ecclesiastical cabal. The sale of the second volume of the
 Encyclopædia was stopped by orders which Malesherbes was reluctantly
 compelled to issue. A decree of the king's council (Feb. 7, 1752)
 suppressed both volumes, as containing maxims hostile to the royal
 authority and to religion. The publishers were forbidden to reprint
 them, and the booksellers were forbidden to deliver any copies that
 might still be in hand. The decree, however, contained no prohibition
 of the continuance of the work. It was probably not meant to do
 anything more serious than to pacify the Jesuits, and lend an apparent
 justification to the officious pastorals of the great prelates. Some
 even thought that the aim of the government was to forestall severer
 proceedings on the part of the parliament of lawyers;<a name=
 "FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> for corporations of
 lawyers have seldom been less bigoted or obstructive than corporations
 of churchmen. Nor were lawyers and priests the only foes. Even the
 base and despicable jealousies of booksellers counted for something in
 the storm.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id=
 "FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class=
 "fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

 <p>A curious triumph awaited the harassed Diderot.</p>

 <p>He was compelled, under pain of a second incarceration, to hand
 over to the authorities all the papers, proof-sheets, and plates in
 his possession. The Jesuit cabal supposed that if they could obtain
 the materials for the future volumes, they could easily arrange and
 manipulate them to suit their own purposes. Their ignorance and
 presumption were speedily confounded. In taking Diderot's papers, they
 had forgotten, as Grimm says, to take his head and his genius: they
 had forgotten to ask him for a key to articles which, so far from
 understanding, they with some confusion vainly strove even to
 decipher. The government was obliged (May 1752) to appeal to Diderot
 and D'Alembert to resume a work for which their enemies had thus
 proved themselves incompetent. Yet, by one of the meannesses of
 decaying authority, the decree of three months before was left
 suspended over their heads.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id=
 "FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class=
 "fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

 <p>The third volume of the Encyclopædia appeared in the autumn of
 1753. D'Alembert prefixed an introduction, vindicating himself and his
 colleague with a manliness, a sincerity, a gravity, a fire, that are
 admirable and touching. "What," he concluded, "can malignity
 henceforth devise against two men of letters, trained long since by
 their meditations to fear neither injustice nor poverty; who having
 learnt by a long and mournful experience, not to despise, but to
 mistrust and dread men, have the courage to love them, and the
 prudence to flee them?... After having been the stormy and painful
 occupation of the most precious years of our life, this work will
 perhaps be the solace of its close. May it, when both we and our
 enemies alike have ceased to exist, be a durable monument of the good
 intention of the one, and the injustice of the other.... Let us
 remember the fable of Bocalina: 'A traveller was disturbed by the
 importunate chirrupings of the grasshoppers; he would fain have slain
 them every one, but only got belated and missed his way; he need only
 have fared peacefully on his road, and the grasshoppers would have
 died of themselves before the end of a week.'"<a name=
 "FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> A volume was now
 produced in each year, until the autumn of 1757 and the issue of the
 seventh volume. This brought the work down to Gyromancy and Gythiuin.
 Then there arose storms and divisions which marked a memorable epoch
 alike in the history of the book, in the life of Diderot and others,
 and in the thought of the century. The progress of the work in
 popularity during the five years between 1752 and 1757 had been steady
 and unbroken. The original subscribers were barely two thousand. When
 the fourth volume appeared, there were three thousand. The seventh
 volume found nearly a thousand more.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id=
 "FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class=
 "fnanchor">[137]</a> Such prodigious success wrought the chagrin of
 the party of superstition to fever heat. As each annual volume came
 from the press and found a wider circle of readers than its
 predecessor, their malice and irritation waxed a degree more intense.
 They scattered malignant rumours abroad; they showered pamphlets; no
 imputation was too odious or too ridiculous for them. Diderot,
 D'Alembert, Voltaire, Rousseau, Buffon, were declared to have
 organised a league of writers, with the deliberate purpose of
 attacking the public tranquillity and overthrowing society. They were
 denounced as heads of a formal conspiracy, a clandestine association,
 a midnight band, united in a horrible community of pestilent opinions
 and sombre interests.</p>

 <p>In the seventh volume an article appeared which made the ferment
 angrier than it had ever been. D'Alembert had lately been the guest of
 Voltaire at Ferney, whence he had made frequent visits to Geneva. In
 his intercourse with the ministers of that famous city, he came to the
 conclusion that their religious opinions were really Socinian, and
 when he wrote the article on Geneva he stated this. He stated it in
 such a way as to make their heterodox opinions a credit to Genevese
 pastors, because he associated disbelief in the divinity of Jesus
 Christ, in mysteries of faith, and in eternal punishment, with a
 practical life of admirable simplicity, purity, and tolerance. Each
 line of this eulogy on the Socinian preachers of Geneva, veiled a
 burning and contemptuous reproach against the cruel and darkened
 spirit of the churchmen in France. Jesuit and Jansenist, loose abbès
 and debauched prelates, felt the quivering of the arrow in the quick,
 as they read that the morals of the Genevese pastors were exemplary;
 that they did not pass their lives in furious disputes upon
 unintelligible points; that they brought no indecent and persecuting
 accusation against one another before the civil magistrate. There was
 gall and wormwood to the orthodox bigot in the harmless statement that
 "Hell, which is one of the principal articles of our belief, has
 ceased to be one with many of the ministers of Geneva; it would be,
 according to them, a great insult to the divinity, to imagine that
 this Being, so full of justice and goodness, is capable of punishing
 our faults by an eternity of torment: they explain in as good a sense
 as they can the formal passages of Scripture which are contrary to
 their opinion, declaring that we ought never in the sacred books to
 take anything literally, that seems to wound humanity and reason." And
 we may be sure that D'Alembert was thinking less of the consistory and
 the great council of Geneva, than of the priests and the parliament of
 Paris, when he praised the Protestant pastors, not only for their
 tolerance, but for confining themselves within their proper functions,
 and for being the first to set an example of submission to the
 magistrates and the laws. The intention of this elaborate and,
 reasoned account of the creed and practice of a handful of preachers
 in a heretical town, could not be mistaken by those at whom it was
 directed. It produced in the black ranks of official orthodoxy fully
 as angry a shock as its writer could have designed.</p>

 <p>The church had not yet, we must remember, borrowed the principles
 of humanity and tolerance from atheists. It was not the comparatively
 purified Christian doctrine of our own time with which the
 Encyclopædists did battle, but an organised corporation, with
 exceptional tribunals, with special material privileges, with dungeons
 and chains at their disposal. We have to realise that official
 religion was then a strange union of Byzantine decrepitude, with the
 energetic ferocity of the Holy Office. Within five years of this
 indirect plea of D'Alembert for tolerance and humanity, Calas was
 murdered by the orthodoxy of Toulouse. Nearly ten years later (1766),
 we find Lewis XV., with the steam of the Parc aux Cerfs about him,
 rewarded by the loyal acclamations of a Parisian crowd, for descending
 from his carriage as a priest passed bearing the sacrament, and
 prostrating himself in the mud before the holy symbol.<a name=
 "FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> In the same year the
 youth La Barre was first tortured, then beheaded, then burnt, for some
 presumed disrespect to the same holy symbol—then become the hateful
 ensign of human degradation, of fanatical cruelty, of rancorous
 superstition. Yet I should be sorry to be unjust. It is to be said
 that even in these bad days when religion meant cruelty and cabal, the
 one or two men who boldly withstood to the face the king and the
 Pompadour for the vileness of their lives, were priests of the
 church.</p>

 <p>D'Alembert's article hardly goes beyond what to us seem the axioms
 of all men of sense. We must remember the time. Even members of the
 philosophic party itself, like Grimm, thought the article misplaced
 and hardy.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id=
 "FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class=
 "fnanchor">[139]</a> The Genevese ministers indignantly repudiated the
 compliment of Socinianism, and the eulogy of being rather less
 irrational than their neighbours. Voltaire read and read again with
 delight, and plied the writer with reiterated exhortations in every
 key, not to allow himself to be driven from the great work by the
 raging of the heathen and the vain imaginings of the people.<a name=
 "FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

 <p>While the storm seemed to be at its height, an incident occurred
 which let loose a new flood of violent passion. Helvétius published
 that memorable book in which he was thought to have told all the world
 its own secret. His <i>De l'Esprit</i> came out in 1758.<a name=
 "FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> It provoked a general
 insurrection of public opinion. The devout and the heedless agreed in
 denouncing it as scandalous, licentious, impious, and pregnant with
 peril. The philosophic party felt that their ally had dealt a sore
 blow to liberty of thought and the free expression of opinion.
 "Philosophy," said Grimm, by philosophy, as I have said, meaning
 Liberalism, "will long feel the effect of the rising of opinion which
 this author has caused by his book; and for having described too
 freely a morality that is bad and false in itself, M. Helvétius will
 have to reproach himself with all the restraints that are now sure to
 be imposed on the few men of lofty genius who still are left to us,
 whose destiny was to enlighten their fellows, and to spread truth over
 the earth."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id=
 "FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class=
 "fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

 <p>At the beginning of 1759 the procureur-général laid an information
 before the court against Helvétius's book, against half a dozen minor
 publications, and finally against the Encyclopædia. The <i>De
 l'Esprit</i> was alleged to be a mere abridgment of the Encyclopædia,
 and the Encyclopædia was denounced as being the opprobrium of the
 nation by its impious maxims and its hostility to morals and religion.
 The court appointed nine commissaries to examine the seven volumes,
 suspending their further sale or delivery in the meanwhile. When the
 commissaries sent in their report a month later, the parliament was
 dissatisfied with its tenour, and appointed four new examiners, two of
 them being theologians and two of them lawyers. Before the new censors
 had time to do their work, the Council of State interposed with an
 arbitrary decree (March 1759) suppressing the privilege which had been
 conceded in 1746; prohibiting the sale of the seven volumes already
 printed, and the printing of any future volumes under pain of
 exemplary punishment.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id=
 "FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class=
 "fnanchor">[143]</a> The motive for this intervention has never been
 made plain. One view is that the king's government resented the action
 of the law courts, and that the royal decree was only an episode in
 the quarrel then raging between the crown and the parliaments. Another
 opinion is that Malesherbes or</p>

 <p>Choiseul was anxious to please the dauphin and the Jesuit party at
 Versailles. The most probable explanation is that the authorities were
 eager to silence one at least of the three elements of opposition, the
 Jansenists, the lawyers, and the philosophers,—who were then
 distracting the realm. The two former were beyond their direct reach.
 They threw themselves upon the foe who happened to be most
 accessible.</p>

 <p>The government, however, had no intention of finally exterminating
 an enemy who might at some future day happen to be a convenient ally.
 They encouraged or repressed the philosophers according to the
 political calculations of the moment, sometimes according to the
 caprices of the king's mistress, or even a minister's mistress. When
 the clergy braved the royal authority, the hardiest productions were
 received with indulgence. If the government were reduced to satisfy
 the clergy, then even the very commonplaces of the new philosophy
 became ground for accusation. The Encyclopædia was naturally exposed
 in a special degree to such alternations of favour and
 suspicion.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id=
 "FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class=
 "fnanchor">[144]</a> The crisis of 1759 furnishes a curious
 illustration of this. As we have seen, in the spring of that year the
 privilege was withdrawn from the four associated booksellers, and the
 continuance of the work strictly prohibited. Yet the printing was not
 suspended for a week. Fifty compositors were busily setting up a book
 which the ordinance of the government had decisively forbidden under
 heavy penalties.</p>

 <p>The same kind of connivance was practised to the advantage of other
 branches of the opposition. Thirty years before this, the organ of the
 Jansenist party was peremptorily suppressed. The police instituted a
 rigorous search, and seized the very presses on which the Nouvelles
 Ecclésiastiques was being printed. But the journal continued to
 appear, and was circulated, just as regularly as before.<a name=
 "FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

 <p>The history of the policy of authority towards the Encyclopædia is
 only one episode in the great lesson of the reign of Lewis XV. It was
 long a common mistake to think of this king's system of government as
 violent and tyrannical. In truth, its failure and confusion resulted
 less from the arbitrariness of its procedure, than from the hopeless
 absence of tenacity, conviction, and consistency in the substance and
 direction of its objects. And this, again, was the result partly of
 the complex and intractable nature of the opposition with which
 successive ministers had to deal, and partly of the overpowering
 strength of those Asiatic maxims of government which Richelieu and
 Lewis XIV. had invested with such ruinous prestige. The impatience and
 charlatanry of emotional or pseudo-scientific admirers of a personal
 system blind them to the permanent truth, of which the succession of
 the decrepitude of Lewis XV. to the strength of his great-grandfather,
 and of the decrepitude of Napoleon III. to the strength of his uncle,
 are only illustrations.</p>

 <p>The true interest of all these details about a mere book lies in
 the immense significance of the movement of political ideas and forces
 to which they belong. The true interest of all history lies in the
 spectacle which it furnishes of the growth and dissolution, the shock
 and the transformation, incessantly at work among the great groups of
 human conceptions. The decree against the Encyclopædia marks the
 central moment of a collision between two antagonistic conceptions
 which disputed, and in France still dispute, with one another the
 shaping and control of institutions. One of these ideas is the
 exclusion of political authority from the sphere and function of
 directing opinion; it implies the absolute secularisation of
 government. The rival idea prompted the massacre of St. Bartholomew,
 the dragonnades, the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and all the
 other acts of the same policy, which not only deprived France of
 thousands of the most conscientious and most ingenious of her sons,
 but warped and corrupted the integrity of the national conscience. It
 is natural that we should feel anger at the arbitrary attempt to
 arrest Diderot's courageous and enlightened undertaking. Yet in truth
 it was only the customary inference from an accepted principle, that
 it is the business or the right of governments to guide thought and
 regulate its expression. The Jesuits acted on this theory, and
 resorted to repressive power and the secular arm whenever they could.
 The Jansenists repudiated the principle, but eagerly practised it
 whenever the turn of intrigue gave them the chance.</p>

 <p>An extraordinary and unforeseen circumstance changed the external
 bearings of this critical conflict of ideas. The conception of the
 duties of the temporal authority in the spiritual sphere had been
 associated hitherto with Catholic doctrine. The decay of that doctrine
 was rapidly discrediting the conception allied with it. But the
 movement was interrupted. And it was interrupted by a man who suddenly
 stepped out from the ranks of the Encyclopædists themselves. Rousseau
 from his solitary cottage at Montmorency (1758) fulminated the
 celebrated letter to D'Alembert on Stage Plays. The article on Geneva
 in the seventh volume of the Encyclopædia had not only praised the
 pastors for their unbelief; it also assailed the time-honoured
 doctrine of the churches that the theatre is an institution from hell
 and an invention of devils. D'Alembert paid a compliment to his
 patriarch and master at Ferney, as well as shot a bolt at his
 ecclesiastical foes in Paris, by urging the people of Geneva to shake
 off irrational prejudices and straightway to set up a playhouse.
 Rousseau had long been brooding over certain private grievances of his
 own against Diderot; the dreary story has been told by me before, and
 happily need not be repeated.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id=
 "FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class=
 "fnanchor">[146]</a> He took the occasion of D'Alembert's mischievous
 suggestion to his native Geneva, not merely to denounce the drama with
 all the force and eloquence at his command, but formally to declare
 the breach between himself and Diderot. From this moment he treated
 the Holbachians—so he contemptuously styled the Encyclopædists—as
 enemies of the human race and disseminators of the deadliest
 poisons.</p>

 <p>This was no mere quarrel of rival authors. It marked a fundamental
 divergence in thought, and proclaimed the beginning of a disastrous
 reaction in the very heart of the school of illumination. Among the
 most conspicuous elements of the reaction were these: the
 subordination of reason to emotion; the displacement of industry,
 science, energetic and many-sided ingenuity, by dreamy indolence; and
 finally, what brings us back to our starting-point, the suppression of
 opinions deemed to be anti-social by the secular arm. The old idea was
 brought back in a new dress; the absolutist conception of the function
 of authority, associated with a theistic doctrine. Unfortunately for
 France, Rousseau's idea prospered, and ended by vanquishing its
 antagonist. The reason is plain. Rousseau's idea exactly fitted in
 with the political traditions and institutions of the country. It was
 more easily and directly compatible than was the contending idea, with
 that temper and set of men's minds which tradition and institutions
 had fixed so disastrously deep in the national character.</p>

 <p>The crisis of 1758-59, then, is a date of the highest importance.
 It marks a collision between the old principle of Lewis XIV., of the
 Bartholomew Massacre, of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and
 the new rationalistic principle of spiritual emancipation. The old
 principle was decrepit, it was no longer able to maintain itself; the
 hounds were furious, but their fury was toothless. Before the new
 principle could achieve mastery, Rousseau had made mastery impossible.
 Two men came into the world at this very moment, whom destiny made
 incarnations of the discordant principles. Danton and Robespierre were
 both born in 1759. Diderot seems to have had a biblical presentiment,
 says Michelet. "We feel that he saw, beyond Rousseau, something
 sinister, a spectre of the future. Diderot-Danton already looks in the
 face of Rousseau-Robespierre."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id=
 "FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class=
 "fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

 <p>A more vexatious incident now befell the all-daring, all-enduring
 Diderot, than either the decree of the Council or the schism of the
 heresiarch at Montmorency. D'Alembert declared his intention of
 abandoning the work, and urged his colleague to do the same. His
 letters to Voltaire show intelligibly enough how he brought himself to
 this resolution. "I am worn out," he says, "with the affronts and
 vexations of every kind that this work draws down upon us. The hateful
 and even infamous satires which they print against us, and which are
 not only tolerated, but protected, authorised, applauded, nay,
 actually commanded by the people with power in their hands; the
 sermons, or rather the tocsins that are rung against us at Versailles
 in the presence of the king, <i>nemine reclamante</i>; the new
 intolerable inquisition that they are bent on practising against the
 Encyclopædia, by giving us new censors who are more absurd and more
 intractable than could be found at Goa; all these reasons, joined to
 some others, drive me to give up this accursed work once for all." He
 cared nothing for libels or stinging pamphlets in themselves, but
 libels permitted or ordered by those who could instantly have
 suppressed them, were a different thing, especially when they vomited
 forth the vilest personalities. He admitted that there were other
 reasons why he was bent on retiring, and it would appear that one of
 these reasons was dissatisfaction with the financial arrangements of
 the booksellers.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id=
 "FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class=
 "fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

 <p>Voltaire for some time remonstrated against this retreat before the
 hated <i>Infâme</i>. At length his opinion came round to D'Alembert's
 reiterated assertions of the shame and baseness of men of letters
 subjecting themselves to the humiliating yoke of ministers, priests,
 and police. Voltaire wrote to Diderot, protesting that before all
 things it was necessary to present a firm front to the foe; it would
 be atrocious weakness to continue the work after D'Alembert had
 quitted it; it was monstrous that such a genius as Diderot should make
 himself the slave of booksellers and the victim of fanatics. Must this
 dictionary, he asked, which is a hundred times more useful than
 Bayle's, be fettered with the superstition which it should annihilate;
 must they make terms with scoundrels who keep terms with none; could
 the enemies of reason, the persecutors of philosophers, the assassins
 of our kings, still dare to lift up their voices in such a century as
 that? "Men are on the eve of a great revolution in the human mind, and
 it is you to whom they are most of all indebted for it."<a name=

 <p>More than once Voltaire entreated Diderot to finish his work in a
 foreign country where his hands would be free. "No," said Diderot in a
 reply of pathetic energy; "to abandon the work is turning our back
 upon the breach, and to do precisely what the villains who persecute
 us desire. If you knew with what joy they have learnt D'Alembert's
 desertion! It is not for us to wait until the government have punished
 the brigands to whom they have given us up. Is it for us to complain,
 when they associate with us in their insults men who are so much
 better than ever we shall be? What ought we to do then? Do what
 becomes men of courage,—despise our foes, follow them up, and take
 advantage, as we have done, of the feebleness of our censors. If
 D'Alembert resumes, and we complete our work, is not that vengeance
 enough?... After all this, you will believe that I cling at any price
 to the Encyclopædia, and you will be mistaken. My dear master, I am
 over forty. I am tired out with tricks and shufflings. I cry from
 morning till night for rest, rest; and scarcely a day passes when I am
 not tempted to go and live in obscurity and die in peace in the depths
 of my old country. There comes a time when all ashes are mingled. Then
 what will it boot me to have been Voltaire or Diderot, or whether it
 is your three syllables or my three syllables that survive? One must
 work, one must be useful, one owes an account of one's gifts,
 etcetera, etcetera. Be useful to men! Is it quite clear that one does
 more than amuse them, and that there is much difference between the
 philosopher and the flute-player? They listen to one or the other with
 pleasure or disdain, and remain what they were. The Athenians were
 never wickeder than in the time of Socrates, and perhaps all that they
 owe to his existence is a crime the more. That there is more spleen
 than good sense in all this, I admit—and back I go to the
 Encyclopædia."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id=

 "fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

 <p>Thus for seven years the labour of conducting the vast enterprise
 fell upon Diderot alone. He had not only to write articles upon the
 most exhausting and various kinds of subjects; he had also to
 distribute topics among his writers, to shape their manuscripts, to
 correct proof-sheets, to supervise the preparation of the engravings,
 to write the text explanatory of them, and all this amid constant
 apprehension and alarm from the government and the police. He would
 have been free from persecution at Lausanne or at Leyden. The two
 great sovereigns of the north who thought it part of the trade of a
 king to patronise the new philosophy, offered him shelter at
 Petersburg or Berlin.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id=
 "FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class=
 "fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

 <p>But how could he transport to the banks of the Neva or the Spree
 his fifty skilled compositors, his crafty engravers on copper-plate,
 and all the host of his industrial army? How could he find in those
 half-barbarous lands the looms and engines and thousand cunning
 implements and marvellous processes which he had under his eye and
 ready to his hand in France? And so he held fast to his post on the
 fifth floor of the house in the Rue Saint Benoît, a standing marvel to
 the world of letters for all time.</p>

 <p>As his toil was drawing to a close, he suddenly received the most
 mortifying of all the blows that were struck at him in the course of
 his prolonged, hazardous, and tormenting adventure. After the
 interruption in 1759, it was resolved to bring out the ten volumes
 which were still wanting, in a single issue. Le Breton was entrusted
 with the business of printing them. The manuscript was set in type,
 Diderot corrected the proof-sheets, saw the revises, and returned each
 sheet duly marked with his signature for the press. At this point the
 nefarious operation of Le Breton began. He and his foreman took
 possession of the sheets, and proceeded to retrench, cut out, and
 suppress every passage, line, or phrase, that appeared to them to be
 likely to provoke clamour or the anger of the government. They thus,
 of their own brute authority, reduced most of the best articles to the
 condition of fragments mutilated and despoiled of all that had been
 most valuable in them. The miscreants did not even trouble themselves
 to secure any appearance of order or continuity in these mangled
 skeletons of articles. Their murderous work done, they sent the pages
 to the press, and to make the mischief beyond remedy, they committed
 all the original manuscripts and proof-sheets to the flames. One day,
 when the printing was nearly completed (1764), Diderot having occasion
 to consult an article under the letter S, found it entirely spoiled.
 He stood confounded. An instant's thought revealed the printer's
 atrocity. He eagerly turned to the articles on which he and his
 subordinates had taken most pains, and found everywhere the same
 ravages and disorder. "The discovery," says Grimm, "threw him into a
 state of frenzy and despair which I shall never forget."<a name=
 "FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> He wept tears of rage
 and torment in the presence of the criminal himself, and before wife
 and children and sympathising domestics. For weeks he could neither
 eat nor sleep. "For years," he cried to Le Breton, "you have been
 basely cheating me. You have massacred, or got a brute beast to
 massacre, the work of twenty good men who have devoted to you their
 time, their talents, their vigils, from love of right and truth, from
 the simple hope of seeing their ideas given to the public, and reaping
 from them a little consideration richly earned, which your injustice
 and thanklessness have now stolen from them for ever.... You and your
 book will be dragged through the mire; you will henceforth be cited as
 a man who has been guilty of an act of treachery, an act of vile
 hardihood, to which nothing that has ever happened in this world can
 be compared. Then you will be able to judge your panic terror, and the
 cowardly counsels of those barbarous Ostrogoths and stupid Vandals who
 helped you in the havoc you have made."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id=

 <p>Yet he remained undaunted to the very last. His first movement to
 throw up the work, and denounce Le Breton's outrage to the subscribers
 and the world, was controlled. His labour had lost its charm. The
 monument was disfigured and defaced. He never forgot the horrible
 chagrin, and he never forgave the ignoble author of it. But the last
 stone was at length laid. In 1765 the subscribers received the
 concluding ten volumes of letterpress. The eleven volumes of plates
 were not completed until 1772. The copies bore Neufchâtel on the
 title-page, and were distributed privately. The clergy in their
 assembly at once levelled a decree at the new book. The parliament
 quashed this, not from love of the book, but from hatred of the
 clergy. The government, however, ordered all who possessed the
 Encyclopædia to deliver it over forthwith to the police. Eventually
 the copies were returned to their owners with some petty
 curtailments.</p>

 <p>Voltaire has left us a vivacious picture of authority in grave
 consultation over the great engine of destruction. With that we may
 conclude our account of its strange eventful history.</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>A servant of Lewis xv. told me that one day the king his master
  supping at Trianon with a small party, the talk happened to turn
  first upon the chase, and next on gunpowder. Some one said that the
  best powder was made of equal parts of saltpetre, of sulphur, and of
  charcoal. The Duke de la Vallière, better informed, maintained that
  to make good gunpowder you required one part of sulphur and one of
  charcoal to five parts of saltpetre.</p>

  <p>"It is curious," said the Duke de Nivernois, "that we should amuse
  ourselves every day in killing partridges at Versailles, and
  sometimes in killing men or getting ourselves killed on the frontier,
  without knowing exactly how the killing is done."</p>

  <p>"Alas," said Madame de Pompadour, "we are all reduced to that
  about everything in the world: I don't know how they compound the
  rouge that I put on my cheeks, and I should be vastly puzzled if they
  were to ask me how they make my silk stockings."</p>

  <p>"'Tis a pity, then," said the Duke de la Vallière, "that his
  Majesty should have confiscated our Encyclopædias, which cost us a
  hundred pistoles apiece: we should soon find there an answer to all
  our difficulties."</p>

  <p>The king justified the confiscation: he had been warned that
  one-and-twenty folios, that were to be found on the dressing-tables
  of all the ladies, were the most dangerous thing in all the world for
  the kingdom of France; and he meant to find out for himself whether
  this were true or not, before letting people read the book. When
  supper was over, he sent three lackeys for the book, and they
  returned each with a good deal of difficulty carrying seven
  volumes.</p>

  <p>It was then seen from the article <i>Powder</i> that the Duke de
  la Vallière was right; and then Madame de Pompadour learnt the
  difference between the old rouge of Spain, with which the ladies of
  Madrid coloured their faces, and the rouge of the ladies of Paris.
  She knew that the Greek and Roman ladies were painted with the purple
  that came from the <i>murex</i>, and that therefore our scarlet is
  the purple of the ancients; that there was more saffron in the rouge
  of Spain, and more cochineal in that of France.</p>

  <p>She saw how they made her stockings by loom; and the machine
  transported her with amazement.</p>

  <p>Everyone threw himself on the volumes like the daughters of
  Lycomedes on the ornaments of Ulysses; every one immediately found
  all he sought. Those who were at law were surprised to see their
  affair decided. The king read all about the rights of his crown. "But
  upon my word," he said, "I can't tell why they spoke so ill of this
  book." "Do you not see, sire, said the Duke de Nivernois, "it is
  because the book is so good; people never cry out against what is
  mediocre or common in anything. If women seek to throw ridicule on a
  new arrival, she is sure to be prettier than they are."</p>

  <p>All this time they kept on turning over the leaves; and the Count
  de C—— said aloud—"Sire, how happy you are, that under your reign men
  should be found capable of understanding all the arts and
  transmitting them to posterity. Everything is here, from the way to
  make a pin down to the art of casting and pointing your guns; from
  the infinitely little up to the infinitely great. Thank God for
  having brought into the world in your kingdom the men who have done
  such good work for the whole universe. Other nations must either buy
  the Encyclopædia, or else they must pirate it. Take all my property
  if you will, but give me back my Encyclopædia."</p>

  <p>"Yet they say," replied the king, "that there are many faults in
  this work, necessary and admirable as it is."</p>

  <p>"Sire," said the Count de C——, "there were at your supper two
  ragouts which were failures; we left them uneaten, and yet we had
  excellent cheer. Would you have had them throw all the supper out of
  the window because of those two ragouts?..."</p>

  <p>Envy and Ignorance did not count themselves beaten; the two
  immortal sisters continued their cries, their cabals, their
  persecutions. What happened? Foreigners brought out four editions of
  this French book which in France was proscribed, and they gained
  about 1,800,000 crowns.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id=

  "fnanchor">[154]</a></p>
 </div>

 <p>In a monotonous world it is a pity to spoil a striking effect, yet
 one must be vigilant. It has escaped the attention of writers who have
 reproduced this lively scene, that Madame de Pompadour was dead before
 the volumes containing Powder and Rouge were born. The twenty-one
 volumes were not published until 1765, and she died in the spring of
 the previous year. But the substance of the story is probably true,
 though Voltaire has only made a slip in a name.</p>

 <p>As to the reference with which Voltaire impatiently concludes, we
 have to remember that the work was being printed at Geneva as it came
 out in Paris. It was afterwards reprinted as a whole both at Geneva
 (1777) and at Lausanne (1778). An edition appeared at Leghorn in 1770,
 and another at Lucca in 1771. Immediately after the completion of the
 Encyclopædia there began to appear volumes of selections from it. The
 compilers of these anthologies (for instance of an <i>Esprit de
 l'Encydopédie</i> published at Geneva in 1768) were free from all
 intention of proselytising. They meant only to turn a more or less
 honest penny by serving up in neat duodecimos the liveliest, most
 curious, and most amusing pieces to be found in the immense mass of
 the folios of the original.</p>

 <p>The Encyclopædia of Diderot, though not itself the most prodigious
 achievement on which French booksellers may pride themselves, yet
 inspired that achievement. In 1782 Panckoucke—a familiar name in the
 correspondence of Voltaire and the Voltairean family—conceived the
 plan of a Methodical Encyclopædia. This colossal work, which really
 consists of a collection of special cyclopædias for each of the
 special sciences, was not completed until 1832, and comprises one
 hundred and sixty-six volumes of text, with a score more volumes of
 plates. It has no unity of doctrine, no equal application of any set
 of philosophic principles, and no definite social aim. The only
 encyclopædia since 1772 with which I am acquainted, that is planned
 with a view to the presentation of a general body of doctrine, is the
 unfinished Encyclopédie Nuevelle of Pìerre Leroux and Jean Reynaud.
 This work was intended to apply the socialistic and spiritualistic
 ideas of its authors over the whole field of knowledge and
 speculation. The result is that it furnishes only a series of
 dissertations, and is not an encyclopædia in the ordinary
 sense.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

 <p>The booksellers at first spoke of the Encyclopædia as an affair of
 two million livres. It appeared, however that its cost did not go much
 beyond one million one hundred and forty thousand livres. The gross
 return was calculated to be nearly twice as much. The price to the
 subscriber of the seven volumes up to 1757, of the ten volumes issued
 in 1765, and of the eleven volumes of plates completed in 1772,
 amounted to nine hundred and eighty livres,<a name="FNanchor_156_156"
 id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class=
 "fnanchor">[156]</a> or about forty-three pounds sterling of that
 date, equivalent in value to more than three times the sum in money of
 to-day.</p>

 <p>The payment received by Diderot is a little doubtful, and the terms
 were evidently changed from time to time. His average salary, after
 D'Alembert had quitted him, seems to have amounted to about three
 thousand livres, or one hundred and thirty pounds sterling, per annum.
 This coincides with Grimm's statement that the total sum received by
 Diderot was sixty thousand livres, or about two thousand six hundred
 pounds sterling.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id=
 "FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class=
 "fnanchor">[157]</a> And to think, cried Voltaire, when he heard of
 Diderot's humble wage, that an army contractor makes twenty thousand
 livres a day! Voltaire himself had made a profit of more than half a
 million livres by a share in an army contract in the war of 1734, and
 his yearly income derived from such gains and their prudent investment
 was as high as seventy thousand livres, representing in value a sum
 not far short of ten thousand pounds a year of our present money.</p>

 <p>II.</p>

 <p>All writers on the movement of illumination in France in the
 eighteenth century, call our attention to the quick transformation,
 which took place after the middle of the century, of a speculative or
 philosophical agitation into a political or social one. Readers often
 find some difficulty in understanding plainly how or why this
 metamorphosis was brought about. The metaphysical question which men
 were then so fond of discussing, whether matter can think, appears
 very far removed indeed from the sphere of political conceptions. The
 psychological question whether our ideas are innate, or are solely
 given to us by experience through the sensations, may strike the
 publicist as having the least possible to do with the type of a
 government or the aims of a community. Yet it is really the
 conclusions to which men come in this region, that determine the
 quality of the civil sentiment and the significance of political
 organisation. The theological doctors who persecuted De Prades for
 suggestions of Locke's psychology, and for high treason against
 Cartesianism, were guided by a right instinct of self-preservation. De
 Maistre, by far the most acute and penetrating of the Catholic school,
 was never more clear-sighted than when he made a vigorous and
 deliberate onslaught upon Bacon, the centre of his movement against
 revolutionary principles.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id=
 "FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class=
 "fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

 <p>As we have said before, the immediate force of speculative
 literature hangs on practical opportuneness. It was not merely because
 Bacon and Hobbes and Locke had written certain books, that the
 Encyclopædists, who took up their philosophic succession, inevitably
 became a powerful political party, and multiplied their adherents in
 an increasing proportion as the years went on. From various
 circumstances the attack acquired a significance and a weight in
 France which it had never possessed in England. For one thing,
 physical science had in the interval taken immense strides. This both
 dwarfed the sovereignty of theology and theological metaphysics, and
 indirectly disposed men's minds for non-theological theories of moral
 as well as of physical phenomena. In France, again, the objects of the
 attack were inelastic and unyielding. Political speculation in England
 followed, and did not precede, political innovation and reform. In
 France its light played round institutions which were too deeply
 rooted in absolutism and privilege to be capable of substantial
 modification. Deism was comparatively impotent against the Church of
 England, first, because it was an intellectual movement, and not a
 social one; second, because the constitutional doctrines of the church
 were flexible. Deism in the hands of its French propagators became
 connected with social liberalism, because the Catholic church in those
 days was identified with all the ideas of repression. And the
 tendencies of deism in France grew more violently destructive, not
 only because religious superstition was grosser, but because that
 superstition was incorporated in a strong and inexpansible social
 structure.</p>

 <p>"It would be a mistake," wrote that sagacious and well-informed
 observer, D'Argenson, so early as 1753, "to attribute the loss of
 religion in France to the English philosophy, which has not gained
 more than a hundred philosophers or so in Paris, instead of setting it
 down to the hatred against the priests, which goes to the very last
 extreme. All minds are turning to discontent and disobedience, and
 everything is on the high road to a great revolution, both in religion
 and in government. And it will be a very different thing to that rude
 Reformation, a medley of superstition and freedom, which came to us
 from Germany in the sixteenth century! As our nation and our century
 are enlightened in so very different a fashion, they will go whither
 they ought to go; they will banish every priest, all priesthood, all
 revelation, all mystery." This, however, only represents the
 destructive side of the vast change which D'Argenson then foresaw,
 six-and-thirty years before its consummation. That change had also a
 constructive side. If one of its elements was hate, another and more
 important element was hope. This constructive and reforming spirit
 which made its way in the intelligence of the leading men in France
 from 1750 to 1789, was represented in the encyclopædic confederation,
 and embodied in their forty folios. And, to return to our first point,
 it was directly and inseparably associated with the philosophy of
 Bacon and Locke. What is the connection between their speculations and
 a vehement and energetic spirit of social reform? We have no space
 here to do more than barely hint the line of answer.</p>

 <p>The broad features of the speculative revolution of which the
 Encyclopædia was the outcome, lie on the surface of its pages and
 cannot be mistaken. The transition from Descartes to Newton meant the
 definite substitution of observation for hypothesis. The exaltation of
 Bacon meant the advance from supernatural explanations to explanations
 from experience. The acceptance and development of the Lockian
 psychology meant the reference of our ideas to bodily sensations, and
 led men by what they thought a tolerably direct path to the
 identification of mind with functions of matter. We need not here
 discuss the philosophical truth or adequateness of these ways of
 considering the origin and nature of knowledge, or the composition of
 human character. All that now concerns us is to mark their tendency.
 That tendency clearly is to expel Magic as the decisive influence
 among us, in favour of ordered relations of cause and effect, only to
 be discovered by intelligent search. The universe began to be more
 directly conceived as a group of phenomena that are capable of
 rational and connected explanation. Then, the wider the area of law,
 the greater is man's consciousness of his power of controlling forces,
 and securing the results that he desires. Objective interests and
 their conditions acquire an increasing preponderance in his mind. On
 the other hand, as the limits of science expand, so do the limits of
 nescience become more definite. The more we know of the universal
 order, the more are we persuaded, however gradually and insensibly,
 that certain matters which men believed themselves to know outside of
 this phenomenal order, are in truth inaccessible by those instruments
 of experience and observation to which we are indebted for other
 knowledge. Hence, a natural inclination to devote our faculty to the
 forces within our control, and to withdraw it from vain industry about
 forces—if they be forces—which are beyond our control and beyond our
 apprehension. Thus man becomes the centre of the world to himself,
 nature his servant and minister, human society the field of his
 interests and his exertions. The sensational psychology, again,
 whether scientifically defensible or not, clearly tends to heighten
 our idea of the power of education and institutions upon character.
 The more vividly we realise the share of external impressions in
 making men what they are, the more ready we shall be to concern
 ourselves with external conditions and their improvement. The
 introduction of the positive spirit into the observation of the facts
 of society was not to be expected until the Cartesian philosophy, with
 its reliance on inexplicable intuitions and its exaggeration of the
 method of hypothesis, had been laid aside.</p>

 <p>Diderot struck a key-note of difference between the old Catholic
 spirit and the new social spirit, between quietist superstition and
 energetic science, in the casual sentence in his article on
 alms-houses and hospitals: "<i>It would be far more important to work
 at the prevention of misery, than to multiply places of refuge for the
 miserable</i>."</p>

 <p>It is very easy to show that the Encyclopædists had not established
 an impregnable scientific basis for their philosophy. Anybody can now
 see that their metaphysic and psychology were imperfectly thought out.
 The important thing is that their metaphysic and psychology were
 calculated, notwithstanding all their superficialities, to inspire an
 energetic social spirit, because they were pregnant with humanistic
 sentiment. To represent the Encyclopædia as the gospel of negation and
 denial is to omit four-fifths of its contents. Men may certainly, if
 they please, describe it as merely negative work, for example, to
 denounce such institutions as examination and punishment by Torture
 (See <i>Question, Peine</i>), but if so, what gospel of affirmation
 can bring better blessings?<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id=
 "FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class=
 "fnanchor">[159]</a> If the metaphysic of these writers had been a
 thousandfold more superficial than it was, what mattered that, so long
 as they had vision for every one of the great social improvements on
 which the progress and even the very life of the nation depended? It
 would be obviously unfair to say that reasoned interest in social
 improvement is incompatible with a spiritualistic doctrine, but we are
 justified in saying that energetic faith in possibilities of social
 progress has been first reached through the philosophy of sensation
 and experience.</p>

 <p>In describing the encyclopædic movement as being, among other
 things, the development of political interest under the presiding
 influence of a humanistic philosophy, we are using the name of
 politics in its widest sense. The economic conditions of a country,
 and the administration of its laws, are far more vitally related to
 its well-being than the form of its government. The form of government
 is indeed a question of the first importance, but then this is owing
 in a paramount degree to the influence which it may have upon the
 other two sets of elements in the national life. Form of government is
 like the fashion of a man's clothes; it may fret or may comfort him,
 may be imposing or mean, may react upon his spirits to elate or
 depress them. In either case it is less intimately related to his
 welfare than the state of his blood and tissues. In saying, then, that
 the Encyclopædists began a political work, what is meant is that they
 drew into the light of new ideas, groups of institutions, usages, and
 arrangements which affected the real well-being and happiness of
 France, as closely as nutrition affected the health and strength of an
 individual Frenchman. It was the Encyclopædists who first stirred
 opinion in France against the iniquities of colonial tyranny and the
 abominations of the slave trade. They demonstrated the folly and
 wastefulness and cruelty of a fiscal system that was eating the life
 out of the land. They protested in season and out of season against
 arrangements which made the administration of justice a matter of sale
 and purchase. They lifted up a strong voice against the atrocious
 barbarities of an antiquated penal code. It was this band of writers,
 organised by a harassed man of letters, and not the nobles swarming
 round Lewis XV., nor the churchmen singing masses, who first grasped
 the great principle of modern society, the honour that is owed to
 productive industry. They were vehement for the glories of peace, and
 passionate against the brazen glories of war.<a name=
 "FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

 <p>We are not to suppose that the Encyclopædia was the originating
 organ of either new methods or new social ideas. The exalted and
 peculiarly modern views about peace, for instance, were plainly
 inspired from the writings of the Abbé Saint Pierre (1658-1743)—one of
 the most original spirits of the century, who deserves to be
 remembered among other good services as the inventor of the word
 <i>bienfaisance</i>. Again, in the mass of the political articles we
 feel the immense impulse that was given to sociological discussion by
 the Esprit des Lois. Few questions are debated here, which Montesquieu
 had not raised, and none are debated without reference to
 Montesquieu's line of argument. The change of which we are conscious
 in turning from the Esprit des Lois to the Encyclopædia is that
 political ideas have been grasped as instruments. Philosophy has
 become patriotism. The Encyclopædists advanced with grave solicitude
 to the consideration of evils, to which the red-heeled parasites of
 Versailles were insolently and incorrigibly blind.</p>

 <p>The articles on Agriculture, for example, are admirable alike for
 the fulness and precision with which they expose the actual state of
 France; for the clearness with which they trace its deplorable
 inadequateness back to the true sources; and for the strong interest
 and sympathy in the subject, which they both exhibit and inspire. If
 now and again the touch is too idyllic, it was still a prodigious gain
 to let the country know in a definite way that of the fifty million
 arpents of cultivable land in the realm, more than one quarter lay
 either unbroken or abandoned. And it was a prodigious gain to arouse
 the attention of the general public to the causes of the forced
 deterioration of French agriculture, namely, the restrictions on trade
 in grain, the arbitrariness of the imposts, and the flight of the
 population to the large towns. Then the demonstration, corroborated in
 the pages of the Encyclopædia by the two patriotic vaunts of
 contemporary English writers, of the stimulus given to agriculture by
 our system of free exports, contained one of the most useful lessons
 that the French had to learn.</p>

 <p>Again, there are some abuses which cannot be more effectively
 attacked, than by a mere statement of the facts in the plainest and
 least argumentative terms. The history of such an impost as the tax
 upon salt (<i>Gabelle</i>), and a bold outline of the random and
 incongruous fashions in which it was levied, were equivalent to a
 formal indictment. It needed no rhetoric nor discussion to heighten
 the harsh injustice of the rule that "persons who have changed
 domicile are still taxed for a certain time in the seat of their
 former abode, namely, farmers and labourers for one year, and all
 other tax-payers for two years, provided the parish to which they have
 removed is within the same district; and if otherwise, then farmers to
 pay for two years, and other persons for three years" (<i>Taille</i>).
 Thus a man under the given circumstances would have to pay double
 taxes for three years as a penalty for changing his dwelling. We
 already hear the murmur of the <i>cahiers</i> of five-and-twenty years
 later in the account of the transports of joy with which the citizens
 of Lisieux saw the <i>taille proportionelle</i> established (1718),
 and how numerous other cities sent up prayers that the same blessing
 might be conferred on them. "Reasons that it is not for us to divine,
 caused the rejection of these demands; so hard is it to do a good act,
 which everybody talks about, much more in order to seem to desire it,
 than from any intention of really doing it.... To illustrate the
 advantages of this plan, the impost of 1718 with all arrears for five
 years was discharged in twelve months without needless cost or
 dispute. By an extravagance more proper than any other to degrade
 humanity, the common happiness made malcontents of all that class
 whose prosperity depends on the misery of others,"—that is the
 privileged class.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id=

 "fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

 <p>It is no innate factiousness, as flighty critics of French affairs
 sometimes imply, that has made civil equality the passion of modern
 France. The root of this passion is an undying memory of the curse
 that was inflicted on its citizens, morally and materially, by the
 fiscal inequalities of the old <i>régime</i>. The article,
 <i>Privilegé</i>, urges the desirableness of inquiring into the
 grounds of the vast multitude of fiscal exemptions, and of abolishing
 all that were no longer associated with the performance of real and
 useful service. "A bourgeois," says the writer, anticipating a cry
 that was so soon to ring through the land, "a bourgeois in comfortable
 circumstances, and who could himself pay half of the <i>taille</i> of
 a whole parish, if it were imposed in its due proportion,—on payment
 of the amount of his taxes for one or for two years, and often for
 less; without birth, education, or talents, buys a place in a local
 salt office, or some useless charge at court, or in the household of
 some prince.... This man proceeds to enjoy in the public eye all the
 exemptions possessed by the nobility and the high magistracy.... From
 such an abuse of privileges spring two very considerable evils: the
 poorer part of the citizens are always burdened beyond their strength,
 though they are the most useful to the State, since this class is
 composed of those who cultivate the land, and procure a subsistence
 for the upper classes; the other evil is that privileges disgust
 persons of education and talent with the idea of entering the
 magistracy or other professions demanding labour and application, and
 lead them to prefer small posts and paltry offices." And so forth,
 with a gravity and moderation, that were then common in political
 discussion in France. It gradually disappeared in 1789, when it was
 found that the privileged orders, even at that time, in their
 <i>cahiers</i> steadily demanded the maintenance of every one of their
 most odious and iniquitous rights.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id=
 "FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class=
 "fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

 <p>When it is said, then, that the Encyclopædists deliberately
 prepared the way for a political revolution, let us remember that what
 they really did was to shed the light of rational discussion on such
 practical grievances as even the most fatuous conservative in France
 does not now dream of bringing back.</p>

 <p>Let us turn to two other of the most oppressive institutions that
 then scourged France. First the <i>Corvée</i>, or feudal rule which
 forced every unprivileged farmer and peasant in France to furnish so
 many days' labour for the maintenance of the highways. Arthur Young
 tells us, and the statement is confirmed by the Minutes of Turgot,
 that this wasteful, cruel, and inefficient system was annually the
 ruin of many hundreds of persons, and he mentions that no less than
 three hundred farmers were reduced to beggary in filling up a single
 vale in Lorraine.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id=
 "FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class=
 "fnanchor">[163]</a> Under this all-important head, the Encyclopædia
 has an article that does not merely add to the knowledge of its
 readers by a history of the <i>corvées</i>, but proceeds to discuss,
 as in a pamphlet or review article, the inconveniences of the
 prevailing system, and presses schemes for avoiding them. Turgot had
 not yet shown in practice the only right substitute. The article was
 printed in 1754, and it was not until ten years later that this great
 administrator, then become intendant of the Limousin, did away in his
 district with compulsory personal service on the roads, and required
 in its place a money payment assessed on the parishes.<a name=
 "FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The writer of the
 article in the Encyclopædia does not anticipate this obviously
 rational plan, but he paints a striking picture of the thousand abuses
 and miserable inefficiencies of the practice of <i>corvées</i>, and
 his piece illustrates that vigorous discussion of social subjects
 which the Encyclopædia stimulated. It is worth remarking that this
 writer was a sub-engineer of roads and bridges in the generality of
 Tours. The case is one example among others of the importance of the
 Encyclopædia as a centre, to which active-minded men of all kinds
 might bring the fruits of their thought and observation.</p>

 <p>Next to the <i>corvées</i>, the monster grievance of the third
 estate was the system of enrolments for the militia. The article,
 <i>Milice</i>, is very short, but it goes to the root of the matter.
 The only son of a cultivator of moderate means, forced to quit the
 paternal roof at the moment when his labour might recompense his
 straitened parents for the expense of having brought him up, is justly
 described as an irreparable loss. The writer, after hinting that it
 would be well if such an institution were wholly dispensed with, urges
 that at least its object might be more effectively and more humanely
 reached by allowing each parish to provide its due contingent of men
 in its own way. This change was indeed already (1765) being carried
 out by Turgot in the Limousin, and with excellent results. The writer
 concludes with the highly civilised remark, that we ought to weigh
 whether the good of the rural districts, the culture of the land, and
 population, are not preferable objects to the glory of setting
 enormous hosts of armed men on foot after the example of Xerxes. Alas,
 it is one of the discouragements of the student of history, that he
 often finds highly civilised remarks made one or two or twenty
 centuries ago, which are just as useful and just as little heeded now
 as they were when they were made.</p>

 <p>The same reflection occurs to one in reading the article on
 Foundations. As I have already said, this carefully written and
 sagacious piece still remains the most masterly discussion we possess
 of the advantages and disadvantages of endowments. Even now, and in
 our own country, the most fertile and beneficent work to which a
 statesman of energy and courage could devote himself, would be an
 application of the wise principles which were established in the
 Encyclopædia. Passing from <i>Fondation</i> to <i>Foire</i> in the
 same volume, also from the pen of Turgot, we see an almost equally
 striking example of the economic wisdom of the encyclopædic school.
 The provincial fairs, with their privileges, exemptions, exclusions,
 were a conspicuous case of the mischief done by that "mania for
 regulating and guiding everything," which then infected commercial
 administration, and interrupted the natural course of trade by
 imbecile vexations of police. Another vicious example of the same
 principle is exposed in the article on <i>Maîtrises</i>. This must
 have convinced every reader capable of rising above "the holy laws of
 prejudice," how bad faith, idleness, disorder, and all the other evils
 of monopoly were fomented by a system of jealous trade-guilds,
 carrying compulsory subdivision and restriction of all kinds of
 skilled labour down to a degree that would have been laughable enough,
 if it had only been less destructive.</p>

 <p>One of the loudest cries in 1789 was for the destruction of game
 and the great manorial chases or capitaineries. "By game," says Arthur
 Young, "must be understood whole droves of wild boars, and herds of
 deer not confined by any wall or pale, but wandering at pleasure over
 the whole country to the destruction of crops, and to the peopling of
 the galleys by the wretched peasants who presumed to kill them, in
 order to save that food which was to support their helpless
 children."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id=
 "FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class=
 "fnanchor">[165]</a> In the same place he enumerates the outrageous
 and incredible rules which ruined agriculture over hundreds of leagues
 of country, in order that the seigneurs might have sport. In most
 matters the seven volumes of the Encyclopædia which were printed
 before 1757, are more reserved than the ten volumes which were
 conducted by Diderot alone after the great schism of 1759. On the
 subject of sport, however, the writer of the article <i>Chasse</i>
 enumerates all the considerations which a patriotic minister could
 desire to see impressed on public opinion. Some of the paragraphs
 startle us by their directness and freedom of complaint, and even a
 very cool reader would still be likely to feel some of the wrath that
 was stirred in the breast of our shrewd and sober Arthur Young a
 generation later (1787). "Go to the residence of these great nobles,"
 he says, "wherever it may be, and you would probably find them in the
 midst of a forest, very well peopled with deer, wild boar, and wolves.
 Oh! if I were the legislator of France for a day, I would make such
 great lords skip!"<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id=
 "FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class=
 "fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

 <p>This brings us to what is perhaps the most striking of all the
 guiding sentiments of the book. Virgil's Georgics have been described
 as a glorification of labour. The Encyclopædia seems inspired by the
 same motive, the same earnest enthusiasm for all the purposes,
 interests, and details of productive industry. Diderot, as has been
 justly said, himself the son of a cutler, might well bring handiwork
 into honour; assuredly he had inherited from his good father's
 workshop sympathy and regard for skill and labour.<a name=
 "FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The illustrative plates
 to which Diderot gave the most laborious attention for a period of
 almost thirty years, are not only remarkable for their copiousness,
 their clearness, their finish—and in all these respects they are truly
 admirable—but they strike us even more by the semi-poetic feeling that
 transforms the mere representation of a process into an animated scene
 of human life, stirring the sympathy and touching the imagination of
 the onlooker as by something dramatic. The bustle, the dexterity, the
 alert force of the iron foundry, the glass furnace, the gunpowder
 mill, the silk calendry are as skilfully reproduced as the more
 tranquil toil of the dairywoman, the embroiderer, the confectioner,
 the setter of types, the compounder of drugs, the chaser of metals.
 The drawings recall that eager and personal interest in his work, that
 nimble complacency, which is so charming a trait in the best French
 craftsman. The animation of these great folios of plates is
 prodigious. They affect one like looking down on the world of Paris
 from the heights of Montmartre. To turn over volume after volume is
 like watching a splendid panorama of all the busy life of the time.
 Minute care is as striking in them as their comprehensiveness. The
 smallest tool, the knot in a thread, the ply in a cord, the curve of
 wrist or finger, each has special and proper delineation. The reader
 smiles at a complete and elaborate set of tailor's patterns. He
 shudders as he comes upon the knives, the probes, the bandages, the
 posture, of the wretch about to undergo the most dangerous operation
 in surgery. In all the chief departments of industry there are plates
 good enough to serve for practical specifications and working
 drawings. It has often been told how Diderot himself used to visit the
 workshops, to watch the men at work, to put a thousand questions, to
 sit down at the loom, to have the machine pulled to pieces and set
 together again before his eyes, to slave like any apprentice, and to
 do bad work, in order, as he says, to be able to instruct others how
 to do good work. That was no movement of empty rhetoric which made him
 cry out for the Encyclopædia to become a sanctuary in which human
 knowledge might find shelter against time and revolutions. He actually
 took the pains to make it a complete storehouse of the arts, so
 perfect in detail that they could be at once reconstructed after a
 deluge in which everything had perished save a single copy of the
 Encyclopædia. Such details, said D'Alembert, will perhaps seem
 extremely out of place to certain scholars, for whom a long
 dissertation on the cookery or the hair-dressing of the ancients, or
 on the site of a ruined hamlet, or on the baptismal name of some
 obscure writer of the tenth century, would be vastly interesting and
 precious. He suggests that details of economy, and of arts and trades,
 have as good a right to a place as the scholastic philosophy, or some
 system of rhetoric still in use, or the mysteries of heraldry. Yet
 none even of these had been passed over.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id=
 "FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class=
 "fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

 <p>The importance given to physical science and the practical arts, in
 the Encyclopædia, is the sign and exemplification of two elements of
 the great modern transition. It marks both a social and an
 intellectual revolution. We see in it, first, the distinct association
 with pacific labour, of honour and a kind of glory, such as had
 hitherto been reserved for knights and friars, for war and asceticism,
 for fighting and praying.</p>

 <p>It is the definite recognition of the basis of a new society. If
 the nobles and the churchmen could only have understood, as clearly as
 Diderot and D'Alembert understood, the irresistible forces that were
 making against the maintenance of the worn-out system, all the worst
 of the evils attending the great political changes of the last decade
 of the century would have been avoided. That the nobles and churchmen
 would not see this, was the fatality of the Revolution. We have a
 glimpse of the profound transformation of social ideas which was at
 work in the five or six lines of the article, <i>Journalier</i>.
 "Journeyman—a workman who labours with his hands, and is paid
 day-wages. This description of men forms the great part of a nation;
 it is their lot which a good government ought to keep principally in
 sight. If the journeyman is miserable, the nation is miserable." And
 again: "The net profit of a society, if equally distributed, may be
 preferable to a larger profit, if it be distributed unequally, and
 have the effect of dividing the people into two classes, one gorged
 with riches, the other perishing in misery" (<i>Homme</i>).</p>

 <p>The second element in the modern transition is only the
 intellectual side of the first. It is the substitution of interest in
 things for interest in words, of positive knowledge for verbal
 disputation. Few now dispute the services of the schoolmen to the
 intellectual development of Europe. But conditions had fully ripened,
 and it was time to complete the movement of Bacon and Descartes by
 finally placing verbal analysis, verbal definition, verbal inferences,
 in their right position. Form was no longer to take precedence of
 matter. The Encyclopædists are never weary of contrasting their own
 age of practical rationalism with "the pusillanimous ages of taste." A
 great collection of books is described in one article
 (<i>Bibliomanie</i>) as a collection of material for the history of
 the blindness and infatuation of mankind. The gatherer of books is
 compared to one who should place five or six gems under a pile of
 common pebbles. If a man of sense buys a work in a dozen volumes, and
 finds that only half a dozen pages are worth reading, he does well to
 cut out the half dozen pages and fling the rest into the fire.
 Finally, it would be no unbecoming device for every great library to
 have inscribed over its portal, The Bedlam of the Human Mind. At this
 point one might perhaps suggest to D'Alembert that study of the
 pathology of the mind is no bad means of surprising the secrets of
 humanity and life. For his hour, however, the need was not knowledge
 of the thoughts, dreams, and mental methods of the past, but better
 mastery of the aids and instruments of active life. In any case
 Diderot was right when he expressed his preference for the essay over
 the treatise: "an essay where the writer throws me one or two ideas of
 genius, almost isolated, rather than a treatise where the precious
 gems are stifled beneath a mass of iteration.... A man had only one
 idea; the idea demanded no more than a phrase; this phrase, full of
 marrow and meaning, would have been seized with relish; washed out in
 a deluge of words, it wearies and disgusts."<a name="FNanchor_169_169"
 id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class=
 "fnanchor">[169]</a> Rousseau himself does not surpass Diderot or
 D'Alembert in contempt for mere bookishness. We wholly misjudge the
 Encyclopædia, if we treat it either as literature or philosophy.</p>

 <p>The attitude of the Encyclopædia to religion is almost universally
 misrepresented in the common accounts. We are always told that the aim
 of its conductors was to preach dogmatic atheism. Such a statement
 could not be made by any one who had read the theological articles,
 whether the more or the less important among them. Whether Diderot had
 himself advanced definitely to the dogma of atheism at this time or
 not, it is certain that the Encyclopædia represents only the phase of
 rationalistic scepticism. That the criticism was destructive of much
 of the fabric of popular belief, and was designed to destroy it, is
 undeniable, as it was inevitable. But when the excesses of '93 and
 '94—and all the revolutionary excesses put together are but a drop
 compared with the oceans of bloodshed with which Catholicism and
 absolutism have made history crimson—when the crimes and confusion of
 the end of the century are traced by historians to the materialism and
 atheism of the Encyclopædia, we can only say that such an account is a
 misrepresentation. The materialism and atheism are not there. The
 religious attack was prompted and guided by the same social feeling
 that inspired the economic articles. The priest was the enemy of
 society, the patron of indolence, the hater of knowledge, the mutineer
 against the civil laws, the unprofitable devourer of the national
 substance, the persecutor. Sacerdotalism is the object of the
 encyclopædic attack. To undermine this, it was necessary first to
 establish the principle of toleration, because the priest claims to be
 recognised as the exclusive possessor of saving doctrine. Second, it
 was necessary to destroy the principle of miracle, because the priest
 professes himself in his daily rites the consecrated instrument of
 thaumaturgy. "Let a man," says Rosenkranz very truly, "turn over
 hundreds of histories of church, of state, of literature, and in every
 one of them he will read that the Encyclopædia spread abroad an
 irreligious spirit. The accusation has only a relative truth, to the
 extent that the Encyclopædia assailed the belief in miracles, and the
 oppression of conscience supported by a priestly aristocracy."<a name=
 "FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

 <p>It must be admitted that no consistent and definite language is
 adhered to from beginning to end. D'Alembert's prophecy that time
 would disclose to people what the writers really thought, behind what
 fear of the censorship compelled them to say, is only partially
 fulfilled.</p>

 <p>The idea of miracle is sapped not by direct arguments, but by the
 indirect influences of science, and the exposition of the successes of
 scientific method. It was here that the Encyclopædia exerted really
 destructive power, and it did so in the only way in which power of
 that kind can be exerted either wisely or effectually. The miracle of
 a divine revelation, of grace, of the mass, began to wear a different
 look in men's eyes, as they learned more of the physical processes of
 the universe. We should describe the work of the Encyclopædia as being
 to make its readers lose their interest, rather than their belief, in
 mysteries. This is the normal process of theological dissolution. It
 unfolded a vast number of scientific conceptions in all branches of
 human activity, a surprising series of acquisitions, a vivid panorama
 of victories won by the ingenuity and travail of man. A contemplation
 of the wonders that man had wrought for himself, replaced meditation
 on the wonders that were alleged to have been wrought by the gods. The
 latter were not so much denied by the plain reader, as they were
 gradually left out of sight and forgotten. Nobody now cares to
 disprove Jupiter and Juno, Satyrs and Hamadryads.</p>

 <p>Diderot constantly insists on the propriety, the importance, the
 indispensableness of keeping the provinces of science and philosophy
 apart from the province of theology. This separation is much sought in
 our own day as a means of saving theology. Diderot designed it to save
 philosophy. He felt that the distinct recognition of positive thought
 as supreme within the widest limits then covered by it, would
 ultimately lead to the banishment of theological thought to a region
 of its own, too distant and too infertile for men to weary themselves
 in pursuit of it. His conception was to supplant the old ways of
 thinking and the old objects of intellectual interest by new ones. He
 trusted to the intrinsic fitness and value of the new knowledge and
 new views of human life, to displace the old. This marks him for a
 constructive thinker. He replaced barren theological interests that
 had outlived their time, by all those great groups of living and
 fruitful interests which glow and sparkle in the volumes of the
 Encyclopædia. Here was the effective damage that the Encyclopædia
 inflicted on the church as the organ of a stationary superstition.
 Some of the articles remind us on what a strange borderland France
 stood in those days, between debasing credulity and wholesome light.
 We are so sensible of the new air that breathes impalpably over the
 book, that when the old theological fancies appear for form's sake,
 and are solemnly marshalled in orthodox state, the contrast and the
 incongruity are so marked that one is amused by what looks like a
 subtle irony, mocking the censor under his very eyes. Who can help
 smiling at the grave question, <i>Adam, le premier de tous les hommes,
 a-t-il été philosophe?</i> Such disputes as whether it is proper to
 baptize abortions, ceased to interest a public that had begun to
 educate itself by discussions on the virtue of Inoculation.</p>

 <p>Of the gross defects in the execution of the Encyclopædia nobody
 was so sensible as Diderot himself. He drew up a truly formidable list
 of the departments where the work was badly done.<a name=
 "FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> But when the blunders
 and omissions in each subject were all counted, the value of the vast
 grouping of the subjects was hardly diminished. The union of all these
 secular acquisitions in a single colossal work invested them with
 something imposing. Secular knowledge was made to present a massive
 and sumptuous front. It was pictured before the curious eyes of that
 generation as a great city of glittering palaces and stately mansions;
 or else as an immense landscape, with mountains, plains, rocks,
 waters, forests, animals, and a thousand objects, glorious and
 beautiful in the sunlight. Theology became visibly a shrivelled thing.
 Men grew to be conscious of the vastness of the universe. At the same
 time and by the same process the Encyclopædia gave them a key to the
 plan, a guiding thread in the immense labyrinth. The genealogical
 tree, or classification of arts and sciences, which with a few
 modifications was borrowed from Bacon and appeared at the end of the
 Prospectus, is seen to be faulty and inadequate. It distributes the
 various branches of knowledge with reference to faculties of the human
 understanding, instead of grouping them according to their objective
 relations to one another. This led to many awkward results, as when
 the art of printing is placed by the side of orthography as a
 subdivision of Logic, to which also is given the art of heraldry or
 emblazonment. There is awkwardness too in dividing architecture into
 three heads, and then placing civil architecture under national
 jurisprudence, and naval architecture under social jurisprudence,
 while under fine arts no kind of architecture has any place. But when
 we have multiplied these objections to the uttermost, the effect of
 the magnificence and vastness of the scheme remains exactly what it
 was.</p>

 <p>Even more important than the exposition of human knowledge was the
 exposition of the degrees by which it had been slowly reared. The
 Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopædia, of which by far the greater
 and more valuable portion was written by D'Alembert, contains a fine
 survey of the progress of science, thought, and letters since the
 revival of learning. It is a generous canonisation of the great heroes
 of secular knowledge. It is rapid, but the contributions of Bacon,
 Descartes, Newton, Locke, Leibnitz are thrown into a series that
 penetrates the reader's mind with the idea of ordered growth and
 measured progress. This excited a vivid hopefulness of interest, which
 insensibly but most effectually pressed the sterile propositions of
 dogmatic theology into a dim and squalid background. Nor was this all.
 The Preliminary Discourse and the host of articles marshalled behind
 it, showed that the triumphs of knowledge and true opinion had all
 been gained on two conditions. The first of these conditions was a
 firm disregard of authority; the second was an abstention from the
 premature concoction of system. The reign of ignorance and prejudice
 was made inveterate by deference to tradition: the reign of truth was
 hindered by the artificial boundary-marks set mischievously deep by
 the authors of systems. As the whole spirit of theology is both
 essentially authoritative and essentially systematic, this
 disparagement was full of tolerably direct significance. It told in
 another way. The Sorbonne, the universities, the doctors, had
 identified orthodoxy with Cartesianism. "It is hard to believe," says
 D'Alembert in 1750, "that it is only within the last thirty years that
 people have even begun to renounce Cartesianism." He might have added
 that one of the most powerful of his contemporaries, Montesquieu
 himself, remained a rigid Cartesian to the end of his days. "Our
 nation," he says, "singularly eager as it is for novelties in all
 matters of taste, is in matters of science extremely attached to old
 opinions." This remark remains true of France to the present hour, and
 it would be an interesting digression, did time allow, to consider its
 significance. France can at all events count one master innovator, the
 founder of Cartesianism himself. D'Alembert points out that the
 disciples violate the first maxims of their chief. He describes the
 hypothesis of vortices and the doctrine of innate ideas as no longer
 tenable, and even as ridiculous; but do not let us forget, he says
 with a fine movement of candour, that it was Descartes who opened the
 way; he who set an example to men of intelligence, of shaking off the
 yoke of scholasticism, of opinion, of authority—in a word, of
 prejudices and barbarism. Those who remain faithful to his
 hypothetical system, while they abandon his method, may be the last of
 his partisans, but they would assuredly never have been the first of
 his disciples.</p>

 <p>By system the Encyclopædists meant more or less coherent bodies of
 frivolous conjecture. The true merit of the philosopher or the
 physicist is described as being to have the spirit of system, yet
 never to construct a system. The notion expressed in this sentence
 promises a union of the advantages of an organic synthesis, with the
 advantages of an open mind and unfettered inquiry. It would be
 ridiculous to think, says D'Alembert, that there is nothing more to
 discover in anatomy, because anatomists devote themselves to
 researches that may seem to be of no use, and yet often prove to be
 full of use in their consequences. Nor would it be less absurd to lay
 a ban on erudition, on the pretext that our learned men often give
 themselves up to matters of trivial import.</p>

 <p>We are constantly struck in the Encyclopædia by a genuine desire to
 reach the best opinion by the only right way, the way of abundant,
 many-sided, and liberal discussion. The article, for instance, on
 <i>Fermes Générales</i> contains an examination of the question
 whether it is more expedient that the taxes of a nation should be
 gathered by farmers of the revenue, or directly by the agents of the
 government acting on its behalf and under its supervision. Montesquieu
 had argued strongly in favour of a <i>Régie</i>, the second of these
 methods. The writer of the article sets out the nine considerations by
 which Montesquieu had endeavoured to establish his position, and then
 he offers on each of them the strongest observations that occur to him
 in support of the opposite conclusion. At the conclusion of the
 article, the editors of the Encyclopædia append the following note:
 "Our professed impartiality and our desire to promote the discussion
 and clearing up of an important question, have induced us to insert
 this article. As the Encyclopædia has for its principal aim the public
 advantage and instruction, we will insert in the article,
 <i>Régie</i>, without taking any side, all such reasons for and
 against, as people may he willing to submit to us, provided they are
 stated with due sense and moderation." Alas, when we turn to the
 article on <i>Régie</i>, the promise is unfulfilled, and a dozen
 meagre lines disappoint the seeker. But eight years of storm had
 passed, and many a beneficent intention had been wrecked. The
 announcement at least shows us the aim and spirit of the original
 scheme.</p>

 <p>Of the line of argument taken in the Encyclopædia as to Toleration
 we need say nothing. The Encyclopædists were the most ardent
 propagators of the modern principles of tolerance. No one has to be
 reminded that this was something more than an abstract discussion
 among the doctors of social philosophy, in a country where youths were
 broken on the wheel for levity in face of an ecclesiastical
 procession, where nearly every considerable man of the century had
 been either banished or imprisoned for daring to use his mind, and
 which had been half ruined by the great proscription of Protestants
 more than once renewed. The article <i>Tolérance</i> was greatly
 admired in its day, and it is an eloquent and earnest reproduction of
 the pleas of Locke. One rather curious feature in it is the
 reproduction of the passage from the Social Contract, in which
 Rousseau explains the right of the magistrate to banish any citizen
 who has not got religion enough to make him do his duties, and who
 will not make a profession of civil faith. The writer of the article
 interprets this as implying that "atheists in particular, who remove
 from the powerful the only rein, and from the weak their only hope,"
 have no right to claim toleration. This is an unexpected stroke in a
 work that is vulgarly supposed to be a violent manifesto on behalf of
 atheism.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

 <p>Diderot himself in an earlier article (<i>Intolérance</i>) had
 treated the subject with more trenchant energy. He does not argue his
 points systematically, but launches a series of maxims, as with set
 teeth, clenched hands, and a brow like a thundercloud. He hails the
 oppressors of his life, the priests and the parliaments, with a
 pungency that is exhilarating, and winds up with a description of the
 intolerant as one who forgets that a man is his fellow, and for
 holding a different opinion, treats him like a ravening brute; as one
 who sacrifices the spirit and precepts of his religion to his pride;
 as the rash fool who thinks that the arch can only be upheld by his
 hands; as a man who is generally without religion, and to whom it
 comes easier to have zeal than morals. Every page of the Encyclopædia
 was, in fact, a plea for toleration. This embittered the hostility of
 the churchmen to the work more than its attack upon dogma. For most
 ecclesiastics valued power more dearly than truth. And in power they
 valued most dearly the atrocious right of silencing, by foul means or
 fair, all opinions that were not official.</p>

 <p>III.</p>

 <p>Having thus described the general character and purport of the
 Encyclopædia, we have still to look at a special portion of it from a
 more particular point of view. We have already shown how multifarious
 were Diderot's labours as editor. It remains to give a short account
 of his labours as a contributor. Everything was on the same vast
 scale. His industry in writing would have been in itself most
 astonishing, even if it had not been accompanied by the more
 depressing fatigue of revising what others had written. Diderot's
 articles fill more than four of the large volumes of his collected
 works.</p>

 <p>The confusion is immense. The spirit is sometimes historical,
 sometimes controversial; now critical, now dogmatic. In one place
 Diderot speaks in his own proper person, in another as the neutral
 scribe writing to the dictation of an unseen authority. There is no
 rigorous measure and ordered proportion. We constantly pass from a
 serious treatise to a sally, from an elaborate history to a caprice.
 There are not a few pages where we know that Diderot is saying what he
 does not think. Some of the articles seem only to have found a place
 because Diderot happened to have taken an interest in their subjects
 at the moment. After reading Voltaire's concise account of
 Imagination, we are amazed to find Diderot devoting a larger space
 than Voltaire had needed for the subject at large, to so subordinate
 and remote a branch of the matter as the Power of the Imagination in
 Pregnant Women upon the Unborn Young. The article on Theosophs would
 hardly have been so disproportionately long as it is, merely for the
 sake of Paracelsus and Van Helmont and Poiret and the Rosicrucians,
 unless Diderot happened to be curiously and half-sympathetically
 brooding over the mixture of inspiration and madness, of charlatanry
 and generous aim, of which these semi-mystic, semi-scientific
 characters were composed.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id=
 "FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class=
 "fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

 <p>Many of Diderot's articles, again, have no rightful place in an
 Encyclopædia. <i>Genius</i>, for instance, is dealt with in what is
 neither more nor less than a literary essay, vigorous, suggestive,
 diffuse; and containing, by the way, the curious assertion that,
 although there are few errors in Locke and too few truths in
 Shaftesbury, yet Locke is only an acute and comprehensive
 intelligence, while Shaftesbury is a genius of the first order.</p>

 <p>Under the word <i>Laborious</i>, we have only a dozen lines of
 angry reproach against the despotism that makes men idle by making
 property uncertain. Under such words as <i>Frivolous</i>,
 <i>Gallantry</i>, <i>Perfection</i>, <i>Importance</i>,
 <i>Politeness</i>, <i>Melancholy</i>, <i>Glorieux</i>, the reader is
 amused and edified by miniature essays on manners and character,
 seldom ending without some pithy sentence and pointed moral. Sometimes
 (e.g. <i>Grandeur</i>) we have a charming piece after the manner of La
 Bruyère. Under the verb <i>Naítre</i>, which is placed in the
 department of grammar, we find a passage so far removed from grammar
 as the following:—</p>

 <p>"The terms of life and death have nothing absolute; they only
 designate the successive states of one and the same being; for him who
 has been strongly nourished in this philosophy, the urn that contains
 the ashes of a father, a mother, a husband, a mistress, is truly a
 touching object. There still remains in it life and warmth; these
 ashes may perhaps even yet feel our tears and give them response; who
 knows if the movement that our tears stir, as they water those ashes,
 is wholly without sensibility?"</p>

 <p>This little burst of grotesque sentimentalism is one of the pieces
 that justify the description of Diderot as the most German of all the
 French.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Equally characteristic
 and more sensible is the writer's outbreak against Formalists. "The
 formalist knows exactly the proper interval between receiving and
 returning a visit; he expects you on the exact day at the exact time;
 if you fail, he thinks himself neglected and takes offence. A single
 man of this stamp is enough to chill and embarrass a whole company.
 There is nothing so repugnant to simple and upright souls as
 formalities; as such people have within themselves the consciousness
 of the good-will they bear to everybody, they neither plague
 themselves to be constantly displaying a sentiment that is habitual,
 nor to be constantly on the watch for it in others." This is analogous
 to his contempt for the pedants who object to the use of a hybrid
 word: "If it happens that a composite of a Greek word and a Latin word
 renders the idea as well, and is easier to pronounce or pleasanter to
 the ear than a compound of two Greek words and two Latin words, why
 prefer the latter?" (<i>Hibrides</i>). Some articles are simply
 diatribes against the enemy. <i>Pardon</i>, for instance: "It needs
 much attention, much modesty, much skill to wring from others pardon
 for our superiority. The men who have executed a foolish work, have
 never been able to pardon us for projecting a better. We could have
 got from them pardon for a crime, but never for a good action." And so
 forth, with much magnanimous acrimony. <i>Prostitution</i> is only
 introduced for the pleasure of applying the unsavoury word to certain
 critics "of whom we have so many in these days, and of whom we say
 that they prostitute their pens to money, to favour, to lying, and to
 all the vices most unworthy of an honourable man."</p>

 <p>We are constantly being puzzled and diverted by Diderot's ingenuity
 in wandering away from the topic nominally in hand, to insinuate some
 of those doctrines of tolerance, of suspended judgment, or of liberty,
 which lay so much nearer to his heart than any point of mere
 erudition. There is a little article on Aius-Locutius, the Announcing
 Speaker, one of the minor Roman gods. Diderot begins by a few lines
 describing the rise of the deity into repute. He then quotes Cicero's
 pleasantry on the friendly divinity, that when nobody in the world had
 ever heard of him, he delivered a salutary oracle, but after people
 had built him a fine temple, then the god of speech fell dumb. This
 suggests to Diderot to wonder with edifying innocence how so religious
 a people as the Romans endured these irreverent jests in their
 philosophers. By an easy step we pass to the conditions on which
 modern philosophers should be allowed by authority to publish their
 speculations. Diderot throws out the curious hint that it would be
 best to forbid any writing against government and religion in the
 vulgar tongue, and to allow those who write in a learned tongue to
 publish what they please. And so we bid farewell to Aius-Locutius. In
 passing, we ask ourselves whether Diderot's suggestion is not
 available in the discussion of certain questions, where freedom of
 speech in the vernacular tongue is scarcely compatible with the
 <i>reverentia quæ debetur pueris</i>?</p>

 <p>Diderot is never prevented by any mistaken sense of the dignity of
 his enterprise from interspersing his disquisitions on science and
 philosophy with such practical thoughts on the common matters of daily
 life as come into his ingenious head. He suggests, for instance, by
 way of preventing the frauds of cab-drivers on their masters and on
 the public, that all payments of fares should be made to appointed
 officers at the various cab-stations, and that no driver should take
 up a fare except at one of these stations.<a name="FNanchor_175_175"
 id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class=
 "fnanchor">[175]</a> In writing about lackeys, after a word on their
 insolence and on the wretched case in which most of them end their
 days, he points out that the multitude of them is causing the
 depopulation of the fields. They are countrymen who have thronged to
 Paris to avoid military service. Peasants turned lackeys to escape the
 conscription, just as in our own days they turn priests. Then, says
 Diderot, this evil ought to be checked by a tax upon liveries; but
 such a tax is far too sensible ever to be imposed.</p>

 <p>Yet, notwithstanding the practical and fervid temper of his
 understanding, Diderot is not above literary trifling when the humour
 seizes him. If he can write an exhaustive article on Encyclopædia, or
 Spinosa, or Academies, or Weaving, he can also stoop to Anagrams, and
 can tell us that the letters of Frère Jacques Clément, the assassin of
 Henry III., make up the sinister words, <i>C'est l'enfer qui m'a
 créé</i>. He can write a couple of amusing pages on Onomatomancy, or
 divination of a man's fortune from his name; and can record with
 neutral gravity how frequently great empires have been destroyed under
 princes bearing the same name as their first founders; how, again,
 certain names are unlucky for princes, as Cains among the Romans, John
 in France, England, and Scotland, and Henry in France.</p>

 <p>We have now and then an anecdote that is worth reading and worth
 preserving. Thus, under Machiavellist: "I have heard that a
 philosopher, being asked by a great prince about a refutation of
 Machiavellism, which the latter had just published, replied, 'Sire, I
 fancy that the first lesson that Machiavelli would have given to his
 disciple would have been to refute his work.'" Whether Voltaire ever
 did say this to the great Frederick, is very questionable, but it
 would not have been ill said. After the reader has been taken through
 a short course of Arabian philosophy, he is enlivened by a selection
 of poetic sayings about human life from the Rose-garden of Sadi, and
 the whole article winds up with an eastern fable, of no particular
 relevancy, of three men finding a treasure, and of one of them
 poisoning the food for which the other two had sent him; on his return
 they suddenly fell on him and slew him, and then ate the poisoned
 food, and so the treasure fell to none of them.<a name=
 "FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

 <p>We have spoken in the previous section of the contempt expressed by
 D'Alembert for mere literary antiquarianism—a very different thing,
 let us remember, from scientific inquiry into the origin and
 classification of institutions and social organs. Diderot's article on
 the Germans is an excellent illustration of this wholesome
 predominance of the scientific spirit over the superficialities of
 barren erudition. The word "Allemand," says Diderot, "has a great many
 etymologies, but they are so forced, that it is almost as well to know
 none of them, as to know them all. As for the origin of this famous
 stock, all that has been said on that matter, between Tacitus and
 Clovis, is simply a tissue of guesses without foundation." Of course
 in this some persons will see a shameful levity; others will regard it
 as showing very good sense, and a right estimate of what is knowable
 and worth knowing, and what is neither one nor the other. In the
 article on Celibacy we notice the same temper. A few sentences are
 enough for the antiquarianism of the subject, what the Egyptians,
 Greeks, and Romans thought and ordained about celibacy. The substance
 of the article is a reproduction of the Abbé Saint Pierre's discussion
 of the advantages that would be gained for France, with her declining
 population, if her forty thousand curés were allowed to marry, and to
 bring into the world eighty thousand children. We may believe that
 Diderot smiled as he transcribed the Abbé's cunning suggestion that a
 dispensing power to relieve from the obligation of celibacy should be
 recognised in the Pope, and that the Roman court should receive a sum
 of money for every dispensation so granted.</p>

 <p>Although, however, Diderot despised mere bookishness, his article
 on Libraries is one of the longest and most painstaking, furnishing a
 tolerably complete list of the most famous collections, from the
 beginning of books down to the latest additions to the King's Library
 in the Rue Vivienne. In the course of this article he quotes with
 seeming approval the quaint words in which old Richard of Bury, the
 author of the <i>Philobiblon</i> (1340), praised books as the best of
 masters, much as the immortal defender of the poet Archias had praised
 them: "Hi sunt magistri qui nos instruunt sine virgis et ferulis, sine
 cholera, sine pecuniâ; si accedis non dormiunt; si inquiris non se
 abscondunt; non obmurmurant si oberres; cachinnos nesciunt si
 ignores."</p>

 <p>In literature proper, as in philosophy, Diderot loses no
 opportunity of insisting on the need of being content with suspended
 judgment. For instance, he blames historians of opinion for the
 readiness with which they attribute notions found in one or two rabbis
 to the whole of the Jews, or because two or three Fathers say
 something, boldly set this down as the sentiments of a whole century,
 although perhaps we have nothing else save these two or three Fathers
 left of the century, and although we do not know whether their
 writings were applauded, or were even widely known. "It were to be
 wished that people should speak less affirmatively, especially on
 particular points and remote consequences, and that they should only
 attribute them directly to those in whose writings they are actually
 to be found. I confess that the history of the sentiments of antiquity
 would not seem so complete, and that it would be necessary to speak in
 terms of doubt much more often than is common; but by acting otherwise
 we expose ourselves to the danger of taking false and uncertain
 conjectures for ascertained and unquestionable truths. The ordinary
 man of letters does not readily put up with suspensive expressions,
 any more than common people do so." All this is an odd digression to
 be found under the head of Hylopathianism, but it must always remain
 wholesome doctrine.</p>

 <p>We cannot wonder at Diderot's admiration for Montaigne and for
 Bayle, who, with Hume, would make the great trinity of scepticism.
 "The work of Montaigne," said Diderot, "is the touchstone of a good
 intelligence; you may be sure that any one whom the reading of
 Montaigne displeases has some vice either of heart or understanding.
 As for Bayle, he has had few equals in the art of reasoning, and
 perhaps no superior; and though he piles doubt upon doubt, he always
 proceeds with order; an article of his is a living polypus, which
 divides itself into a number of polypuses, all living, engendered one
 from the other."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id=
 "FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class=
 "fnanchor">[177]</a> Yet Diderot had a feeling of the necessity of
 advancing beyond the attitude of Bayle and Montaigne. Intellectual
 suspense and doubt was made difficult to him by his vehement and
 positive demand for emotional certainties.</p>

 <p>Diderot is always ready to fling away his proper subject in a burst
 of moralising. The article on <i>Man</i>, as a branch of natural
 history, contains a correct if a rather superficial account of that
 curious animal; at length the writer comes to a table showing the
 probable duration of life at certain ages. "You will observe," he
 says, "1st, that the age of seven is that at which you may hope a
 longer life; 2d, that at twelve or thirteen you have lived a quarter
 of your life; at twenty-eight or twenty-nine you have lived half; at
 fifty more than three-quarters." And then he suddenly winds up the
 whole performance by the exclamation: "O ye who have laboured up to
 fifty, who are in the enjoyment of comfort, and who still have left to
 you health and strength, what then are you waiting for before you take
 rest? How long will you go on saying <i>To-morrow, to-morrow?</i>"</p>

 <p>There are many casual brilliancies in the way of analogy and
 parallel, many aptnesses of thought and phrase. The Stoics are called
 the Jansenists of Paganism. "For a single blade of grass to grow, it
 is necessary that the whole of nature should co-operate." "A man comes
 to Pyrrhonism by one of two opposite ways; either because he does not
 know enough, or because he knows too much; the latter is not the most
 common way." And so forth.</p>

 <p>If we turn to the group of articles dealing with theology, it is
 difficult for us to know exactly where we are. Sometimes Diderot
 writes of popular superstitions with the gravity proper to a
 dictionary of mythology. Sometimes he sews on to the sober gray of his
 scepticism a purple patch of theistic declamation.<a name=
 "FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The article on Jesus
 Christ is obviously a mere piece of common form, and more than one
 passage in his article on <i>Christianisme</i> is undoubtedly
 insincere. When we come to his more careful article,
 <i>Providence</i>, we find it impossible to extract from it a body of
 coherent propositions of which we could confidently say that they
 represented his own creed, or the creed that he desired his readers to
 bear away in their minds.</p>

 <p>It is hardly worth while to measure the more or the less of his
 adherence to Christianity, or even to Deism, as inferred from the
 Encyclopædia. We need only turn to his private letters to find that he
 is in no degree nor kind an adherent, but the most hardy,
 contemptuous, and thoroughgoing of opponents. At the risk of shocking
 devout persons, I am bound to reproduce a passage from one of his
 letters, in which there can be no doubt that we have Diderot's true
 mind, as distinguished from what it was convenient to print. "The
 Christian religion," he says, "is to my mind the most absurd and
 atrocious in its dogmas; the most unintelligible, the most
 metaphysical, the most intertwisted and obscure, and consequently the
 most subject to divisions, sects, schisms, heresies; the most
 mischievous for the public tranquillity, the most dangerous to
 sovereigns by its hierarchic order, its persecutions, its discipline;
 the most flat, the most dreary, the most Gothic, and the most gloomy
 in its ceremonies; the most puerile and unsociable in its morality,
 considered not in what is common to it with universal morality, but in
 what is peculiarly its own, and constitutes it evangelical,
 apostolical, and Christian morality, which is the most intolerant of
 all. Lutheranism, freed from some absurdities, is preferable to
 Catholicism; Protestantism to Lutheranism, Socinianism to
 Protestantism, Deism, with temples and ceremonies, to Socinianism.
 Since it is necessary that man, being superstitious by nature, should
 have a fetish, the simplest and most harmless will be the best
 fetish."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> We need not discuss nor
 extend the quotation; enough has been said to relieve us from the duty
 of analysing or criticising articles in which Christianity is treated
 with all the formal respect that the secular authority insisted
 upon.</p>

 <p>This formal respect is not incompatible with many veiled and secret
 sarcasms, which were as well understood as they were sharply enjoyed
 by those who read between the lines. It is not surprising that these
 sarcasms were constantly unjust and shallow. Even those of us who
 repudiate theology and all its works for ourselves, may feel a shock
 at the coarseness and impurity of innuendo which now and then
 disfigures Diderot's treatment of theological as of some other
 subjects. For this the attitude of the Church itself was much to
 blame; coarse, virulent, unspiritual as it was in France in those
 days. Voltaire, Diderot, Holbach, would have written in a very
 different spirit, even while maintaining and publishing the same
 attacks on theological opinion, if the Church of France had possessed
 such a school of teachers as the Church of England found in the
 Latitudinarians in the seventeenth century; or such as she finds now
 in the nineteenth century in those who have imported, partly from the
 poetry of Wordsworth, partly from the historic references of the
 Oxford Tracts, an equity, a breadth, an elevation, a pensive grace,
 that effectually forbid the use of those more brutal weapons of
 controversy which were the only weapons possible in France a century
 ago.</p>

 <p>We have already said so much of the great and important group of
 articles on arts and trades, that it is unnecessary to add anything
 further as to Diderot's particular share in them. He visited all the
 workshops in Paris; he sent for information and specifications to the
 most important seats of manufacture in the kingdom; he sometimes
 summoned workmen from the provinces to describe to him the paper works
 of Montargis, and the silk works and velvet works of Lyons.<a name=
 "FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Much of Diderot's work,
 even on great practical subjects, was, no doubt, the reproduction of
 mere book-knowledge acquired at second-hand. Take, for instance,
 Agriculture, which was undoubtedly the most important of all subjects
 for France at that date, as indeed at every other date. There are a
 dozen pages of practical precepts, for which Diderot was probably
 indebted to one of the farmers at Grandval. After this, he fills up
 the article with about twenty pages in which he gives an account of
 the new system of husbandry, which our English Jethro Tull described
 to an unbelieving public between 1731 and 1751. Tull's volume was
 translated into French by Duhamel, with notes and the record of
 experiments of his own; from this volume Diderot drew the pith of his
 article. Diderot's only merit in the matter—and it is hardly an
 inconsiderable one in a world of routine—is that he should have been
 at the pains to seek the newest lights, and above all that he should
 have urged the value of fresh experiments in agriculture. Tull was not
 the safest authority in the world, but it is to be remembered that the
 shrewd-witted Cobbett thought his ideas on husbandry worth
 reproducing, seventy years after Diderot had thought them worth
 compiling into an article.</p>

 <p>It was not merely in the details of the practical arts that Diderot
 wrote from material acquired at second-hand. The article on the
 Zend-Avesta is taken from the Annual Register for 1762. The long
 series of articles on the history of philosophy is in effect a
 reproduction of what he found in Bayle, in Deslandes, and in Brucker.
 There are one or two considerable exceptions. Perhaps the most
 important is under the heading of Spinosa, to which we shall return
 presently. The article on <i>Hobbisme</i> contains an analysis,
 evidently made by the writer's own hand, of the bulk of Hobbes's
 propositions; it is scarcely, however, illuminated by a word of
 criticism. If we turn to the article on <i>Société</i>, it is true, we
 find Hobbes's view of the relations between the civil and temporal
 powers tolerably effectively combated, but even here Diderot hardly
 does more than arm himself with the weapons of Locke.</p>

 <p>Of course, he honestly refers his readers to these sources of wider
 information.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id=
 "FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class=
 "fnanchor">[181]</a> All that we can say of the articles on the
 history of philosophy is that the series is very complete; that
 Diderot used his matter with intelligence and the spirit of criticism,
 and that he often throws in luminous remarks and far-reaching
 suggestions of his own. This was all that the purpose of his book
 required. To imitate the laborious literary search of Bayle or of
 Brucker, and to attempt to compile an independent history of
 philosophy, would have been to sacrifice the Encyclopædia as a whole,
 to the superfluous perfection of a minor part. There is only one
 imperative condition in such a case, namely, that the writer should
 pass the accepted material through his own mind before reproducing it.
 With this condition it was impossible for a man of Diderot's
 indefatigable energy of spirit, not as a rule to comply.</p>

 <p>But this rule too had exceptions. There were cases in which he
 reproduced, as any mere bookmaker might have done, the thought of his
 authority, without an attempt to make it his own. Of the confusion and
 inequalities in which Diderot was landed by this method of mingling
 the thoughts of other people with his own, there is a curious example
 in the two articles on Philosopher and Philosophy. In the first we
 have an essentially social and practical description of what the
 philosopher should be; in the second we have a definition of
 philosophy, which takes us into the regions most remote from what is
 social and practical. We soar to the airiest heights of verbal
 analysis and pure formalism. Nothing can be better, so far as it goes,
 than the picture of the philosopher. Diderot begins by contrasting him
 with the crowd of people, and clever people, who insist on passing
 judgment all day long. "They ignore the scope and limits of the human
 mind; they think it capable of knowing everything; hence they think it
 a disgrace not to pronounce judgment, and imagine that intelligence
 consists in that and nothing else. The philosopher believes that it
 consists in judging rightly. He is better pleased with himself when he
 has suspended his faculty of coming to a conclusion, than if he had
 come to a conclusion without the proper grounds. He prefers to
 brilliancy the pains of rightly distinguishing his ideas, of finding
 their true extent and exact connection. He is never so attached to a
 system as not to feel all the force of the objections to it. Most men
 are so strongly given over to their opinions that they do not take any
 trouble to make out those of others. The philosopher, on the other
 hand, understands what he rejects, with the same breadth and the same
 accuracy as he understands what he adopts." Then Diderot turns
 characteristically from the intellectual to the social side. "Our
 philosopher does not count himself an exile in the world; he does not
 suppose himself in an enemy's country; he would fain find pleasure
 with others, and to find it he must give it; he is a worthy man who
 wishes to please and to make himself useful. The ordinary philosophers
 who meditate too much, or rather who meditate to wrong purpose, are as
 surly and arrogant to all the world as great people are to those whom
 they do not think their equals; they flee men, and men avoid them. But
 our philosopher who knows how to divide himself between retreat and
 the commerce of men is full of humanity. <i>Civil society is, so to
 say, a divinity for him on the earth</i>; he honours it by his
 probity, by an exact attention to his duties, and by a sincere desire
 not to be a useless or an embarrassing member of it. The sage has the
 leaven of order and rule; he is full of the ideas connected with the
 good of civil society. What experience shows us every day is that the
 more reason and light people have, the better fitted they are and the
 more to be relied on for the common intercourse of life."<a name=
 "FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

 <p>The transition is startling from this conception of</p>

 <p>Philosopher as a very high kind of man of the world, to the
 definition of Philosophy as "the science of possibles quâ possibles."
 Diderot's own reflection comes back to us, <i>Combien cette maudite
 métaphysique fait des fous!</i><a name="FNanchor_183_183" id=
 "FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class=
 "fnanchor">[183]</a> We are abruptly plunged from a Baconian into a
 Leibnitzian atmosphere. We should naturally have expected some such
 account of Philosophy as that it begins with a limitation of the
 questions to which men can hope for an answer, and ends in an ordered
 arrangement of the principles of knowledge, with ultimate reference to
 the conditions of morals and the structure of civil societies. We
 should naturally have expected to find, what indeed we do find, that
 the characteristic of the philosopher is to "admit nothing without
 proof, never to acquiesce in illusory notions; to draw rigorously the
 dividing lines of the certain, the probable, the doubtful; above all
 things never to pay himself with mere words." But then these wholesome
 prescriptions come in an article whose definitions and distribution of
 philosophy are simply a reproduction from Christian Wolff, and the
 methods and dialect of Wolff are as essentially alien from the
 positive spirit of the Encyclopædia as they were from the mystic
 spirit of Jacobi.</p>

 <p>Wolff's place in the philosophical succession of German speculation
 (1679-1754) is between Leibnitz and Kant, and until Kant came his
 system was dominant in the country of metaphysics.<a name=
 "FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> It is from</p>

 <p>Wolff that Diderot borrows and throws unassimilated into the pages
 of the Encyclopædia propositions so fundamentally incongruous as this,
 that "among all possibles there must of necessity be a Being
 subsisting by himself; otherwise there would be possible things, of
 the possibility of which no account could be given, an assertion that
 could never be made." It is a curious thing, and it illustrates again
 the strangely miscellaneous quality of Diderot's compilation, that the
 very article which begins by this incorporation of the author of a
 philosophical system expounded in a score of quartos, ends by a
 vigorous denunciation of the introduction of the systematic spirit
 into philosophy.</p>

 <p>I shall venture to quote a hardy passage from another article
 (<i>Pyrrhonienne</i>) which some will think a measure of Diderot's
 philosophical incompetency, and others will think a measure of his
 good sense. "We will conclude," he says, "for our part that as all in
 nature is bound together, there is nothing, properly speaking, of
 which man has perfect, absolute, and complete knowledge, because for
 that he would need knowledge of all. Now as all is bound together, it
 inevitably happens that, from discussion to discussion, he must come
 to something unknown: then in starting again from this unknown point,
 we shall be justified in pleading against him the ignorance or the
 obscurity or the uncertainty of the point preceding, and of that
 preceding this, and so forth, up to the most evident principle. So we
 must admit a sort of sobriety in the use of reason. When step by step
 I have brought a man to some evident proposition, I shall cease to
 dispute. I will listen no longer to a man who goes on to deny the
 existence of bodies, the rules of logic, the testimony of the senses,
 the difference between good and evil, true and false, etc. etc. I will
 turn my back on everybody who tries to lead me away from a simple
 question, to embark me in discussion as to the nature of matter, of
 the understanding of thought, and other subjects shoreless and
 bottomless."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id=
 "FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class=
 "fnanchor">[185]</a> Whatever else may be said of this, we have to
 recognise that it is exactly characteristic of the author. But then
 why have written on metaphysics at all?</p>

 <p>We have mentioned the article on Spinosa. It is characteristic both
 of the good and the bad sides of Diderot's work. Half of it is merely
 a reproduction of Bayle's criticisms on Spinosa and his system. The
 other half consists of original objections propounded by Diderot with
 marked vigour of thrust against Spinosa, but there is no evidence that
 he had gone deeper into Spinosa than the first book of the Ethics.
 There is no certain sign that he had read anything else, or that he
 had more of that before him than the extracts that were furnished by
 Bayle. Such treatment of a serious subject hardly conforms to the
 modern requirements of the literary conscience, for in truth the
 literary conscience has now turned specialist and shrinks from the
 encyclopædic. Diderot's objections are, as we have said, pushed with
 marked energy of speech. "However short away," he says, "you penetrate
 into the thick darkness in which Spinosa has wrapped himself up, you
 discover a succession of abysses into which this audacious reasoner
 has precipitated himself, of propositions either evidently false or
 evidently doubtful, of arbitrary principles, substituted for natural
 principles and sensible truths; an abuse of terms taken for the most
 part in a wrong sense, a mass of deceptive equivocations, a cloud of
 palpable contradictions." The system is monstrous, it is absurd and
 ridiculous. It is Spinosa's plausible method that has deceived people;
 they supposed that one who employed geometry, and proceeded by way of
 axioms and definitions, must be on the track of truth. They did not
 see that these axioms were nothing better than very vague and very
 uncertain propositions; that the definitions were inexact, defective,
 and bizarre.</p>

 <p>We have no space to follow the reasoning by which Diderot supports
 this scornful estimate of the famous thinker, of whom it can never be
 settled whether he be pantheist, atheist, akosmist, or God-intoxicated
 man. He returns to the charge again and again, as if he felt a certain
 secret uneasiness lest for scorn so loudly expressed he had not
 brought forward adequate justification. And the reader feels that
 Diderot has scarcely hit the true line of cleavage that would have
 enabled him—from his own point of view—to shatter the Spinosist
 system. He tries various bouts of logic with Spinosa in connection
 with detached propositions. Thus he deals with Spinosa's third
 proposition, that, <i>in the case of things that have nothing in
 common with one another, one cannot be the cause of the other</i>.
 This proposition, Diderot contends, is false in all moral and
 occasional causes. The sound of the name of God has nothing in common
 with the idea of the Creator which that name produces in my mind. A
 misfortune that overtakes my friend has nothing in common with the
 grief that I feel in consequence. When I move my arm by an act of
 will, the movement has nothing in common in its nature with the act of
 my will; they are very different. I am not a triangle, yet I form the
 idea of one and I examine its properties. So with the fifth
 proposition, that <i>there cannot be in the universe two or more
 substances of the same nature or the same attributes</i>. If Spinosa
 is only talking of the essence of things or of their definition, what
 he says is naught; for it can only mean that there cannot be in the
 universe two different essences having the same essence. Who doubts
 it? But if Spinosa means that there cannot be an essence which is
 found in various single objects, in the same way as the essence of
 triangle is found in the triangle A and the triangle B, then he says
 what is manifestly untrue. It is not, however, until the last two or
 three pages that Diderot sets forth his dissent in its widest
 form.</p>

 <p>"To refute Spinosa," he says at last, "all that is necessary is to
 stop him at the first step, without taking the trouble to follow him
 into a mass of consequences; all that we need do is to substitute for
 the obscure principle which he makes the base of his system, the
 following: namely, that <i>there are several substances</i>—a
 principle that in its own way is clear to the last degree. And, in
 fact, what proposition can be clearer, more striking, more close to
 the understanding and consciousness of man? I here seek no other judge
 than the most just impression of the common sense that is spread among
 the human race.... Now, since common sense revolts against each of
 Spinosa's propositions, no less than against the first, of which they
 are the pretended proofs, instead of stopping to reason on each of
 these proofs where common sense is lost, we should be right to say to
 him:—Your principle is contrary to common sense; from a principle in
 which common sense is lost, nothing can issue in which common sense is
 to be found again."</p>

 <p>The passage sounds unpleasantly like an appeal to the crowd in a
 matter of science, which is as the sin against the Holy Ghost in these
 high concerns. What Diderot meant, probably, was to charge Spinosa
 with inventing a conception of substance which has no relation to
 objective experience; and further with giving fantastic answers to
 questions that were in themselves never worth asking, because the
 answers must always involve a violent wrench of the terms of
 experience into the sphere transcending experience, and because,
 moreover, they can never be verified. Whether he meant this or
 something else, and whether he would have been right or wrong in such
 an intention, we may admit that it would have been more satisfactory
 if in dealing with such a master-type of the metaphysical method as
 Spinosa, so acute a positive critic as Diderot had taken more pains to
 give to his objections the utmost breadth of which they were
 capable.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

 <p>The article on Leibnitz has less original matter in it than that on
 Spinosa. The various speculations of that great and energetic
 intellect in metaphysic, logic, natural theology, natural law, are
 merely drawn out in a long table of succinct propositions, while the
 account of the life and character of Leibnitz is simply taken from the
 excellent <i>éloge</i> which had been published upon him by Fontenelle
 in 1716. Fontenelle's narrative is reproduced in a generous spirit of
 admiration and respect for a genius that was like Diderot's own in
 encyclopædic variety of interest, while it was so far superior to
 Diderot's in concentration, in subtlety, in precision, in power of
 construction. If there could exist over our heads, says Diderot, a
 species of beings who could observe our works as we watch those of
 creatures at our feet, with what surprise would such beings have seen
 those four marvellous insects, Bayle, Descartes, Leibnitz, and Newton.
 And he then draws up a little calendar of the famous men, out of whom
 we must choose the name to be placed at the very head of the human
 race. The list contains, besides Julian the Apostate—who was inserted,
 we may presume, merely by way of playful insult to the ecclesiastical
 enemy—Socrates, Marcus Aurelius, Trajan, Bacon, and the four great
 names that have just been cited. Germany derives as much honour from
 Leibnitz alone, he concludes with unconsidered enthusiasm, as Greece
 from Plato, Aristotle, and Archimedes, all put together. As we have
 said, however, there is no criticism, nor any other sign that Diderot
 had done more than survey the façade of the great Leibnitzian
 structure admiringly from without.</p>

 <p>The article on Liberty would be extremely remarkable, appearing
 where it does, and coming from a thinker of Diderot's general
 capacity, if only we could be sure that Diderot was sincere. As it
 happens, there is good reason to suppose that he was wholly insincere.
 It is quite as shallow, from the point of view of philosophy, as his
 article on the Jews or on the Bible is from the point of view of
 erudition. One reason for this might not be far to seek. We have
 repeatedly observed how paramount the social aim and the social test
 are in Diderot's mind over all other considerations. But this
 reference of all subjects of discussion to the good of society, and
 this measurement of conclusions by their presumed effect on society,
 is a method that has its own dangers. The aversion of ecclesiastics to
 unfettered discussion, lest it should damage institutions and beliefs
 deemed useful to mankind, is the great leading example of this peril.
 Diderot, it might be said by those who should contend that he wrote
 what he thought, did not escape exactly the same predicament, as soon
 as ever he forgot that of all the things that are good for society,
 Truth is the best. Now, who will believe that it is Diderot, the
 persecuted editor of the Encyclopædia, and the author of the manly
 article on Intolerance, who introduces such a passage as the following
 into the discussion of the everlasting controversy of Free Will and
 Necessity: "Take away Liberty, and you leave no more vice nor virtue
 nor merit in the world; rewards are ridiculous, and punishments
 unjust. The ruin of Liberty overthrows all order and all police,
 confounds vice and virtue, authorises every monstrous infamy,
 extinguishes the last spark of shame and remorse, degrades and
 disfigures beyond recovery the whole human race. <i>A doctrine of such
 enormity as this ought not to be examined in the schools; it ought to
 be punished by the magistrates.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id=
 "FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class=
 "fnanchor">[187]</a> Of course, this was exactly what the Jesuits said
 about a belief in God, about revelation, and about the institutions of
 the church. To take away these, they said, is to throw down the
 bulwarks of order, and an attempt to take them away, as by
 encyclopædists or others, ought to be punished by the magistrates.
 Diderot had for the moment clearly lost himself.</p>

 <p>We need hardly be surprised if an article conceived in this spirit
 contains no serious contribution to the difficult question with which
 it deals. Diderot had persuaded himself that, without Free Will, all
 those emotional moralities in the way of sympathy and benevolence and
 justice which he adored would be lowered to the level of mere
 mechanism. "If men are not free in what they do of good and evil,
 then," he cries, in what is surely a paroxysm of unreason, "good is no
 longer good, and evil no longer evil." As if the outward quality and
 effects of good and evil were not independent of the mental operations
 which precede human action. Murder would not cease to be an evil
 simply because it had been proved that the murderer's will to do a bad
 deed was the result of antecedents. Acts have marks and consequences
 of their own, good or bad, whatever may be the state of mind of those
 who do them. But Diderot does not seem to divine the true issue; he
 writes as if Necessarians or Determinists denied the existence of
 volitions, and as if the question were whether volitions do exist.
 Nobody denies that they exist; the real question is of the conditions
 under which they exist. Are they determined by antecedents, or are
 they self-determined, spontaneous, and unconnected? Is Will
 independent of cause?</p>

 <p>Diderot's argumentation is, in fact, merely a protest that man is
 conscious of a Will. And just as in other parts of his article Diderot
 by Liberty means only the existence of Will, so by Liberty he means
 only the healthy condition of the soul, and not its independence of
 causation. We need not waste words on so dire a confusion, nor on the
 theory that Will is sometimes dependent on cerebral antecedents and
 sometimes not. The curious thing is that the writer should not have
 perceived that he was himself in this preposterous theory propounding
 the very principle which he denounced as destructive to virtue,
 ruinous to society, and worthy of punishment by the government. For it
 seems that, after all, the Will of those whose "dispositions are not
 moderate" is not free; and we may surely say that those whose
 dispositions are least moderate, are exactly the most violent
 malefactors against the common weal. One more passage is worth quoting
 to show how little the writer had seized the true meaning of the
 debate. "According to you," he says to Bayle, "it is not clear that it
 is at the pure choice of my will to move my arm or not to move it: if
 that be so, it is then necessarily determined that within a quarter of
 an hour from now I shall lift my hand three times together, or that I
 shall not. Now, if you seriously pretend that I am not free, you
 cannot refuse an offer that I make you; I will wager a thousand
 pistoles to one that I will do, in the matter of moving my hand,
 exactly the opposite to what you back; and you may take your choice.
 If you do think the wager fair, it can only be because of your
 necessary and invincible judgment that I am free." As if the will to
 move or not to move the arm would be uncaused and unaffected by
 antecedents, when you have just provided so strong an antecedent as
 the desire to save a thousand pistoles. It was, perhaps, well enough
 for Voltaire to content himself with vague poetical material for his
 poetical discourse on Liberty, but from Diderot, whether as editor or
 as writer, something better might have been expected than a clumsy
 reproduction of the reasoning by which men like Turretini had turned
 philosophy into the corrupted handmaid of theology.</p>

 <p>The most extraordinary thing about this extraordinary article still
 remains to be told. It was written, we may suppose, between 1757 and
 1762, or about that time. In June, 1756, Diderot wrote to a certain
 Landois, a fellow-worker on the Encyclopædia, a letter containing the
 most emphatic possible repudiation of the whole doctrine of Liberty.
 "Liberty is a word void of sense; there are not and there never can
 have been free beings; we are only what fits in with the general
 order, with organisation, with education, and with the chain of
 events. We can no more conceive a being acting without a motive than
 we can conceive one of the arms of a balance acting without a weight;
 and the motive is always exterior and foreign to us, attached either
 by nature or by some cause or other that is not ourselves. <i>There is
 only one sort of causes, properly speaking, and those are, physical
 causes.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id=
 "FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class=
 "fnanchor">[188]</a> And so forth in the vein of hard and remorseless
 necessarianism, which we shall find presently in the pages of the
 System of Nature.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id=
 "FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class=
 "fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

 <p>There is only one explanation of this flagrant contradiction.
 Diderot must have written on Liberty just as he wrote on Jesus Christ
 or the Bible. He cannot have said what he thought, but only what the
 persons in authority required him to pretend to think. We may he sure
 that a letter to an intimate would be more likely to contain his real
 opinion than an article published in the Encyclopædia. That such
 mystifications are odious, are shameful, are almost too degrading a
 price to pay for the gains of such a work, we may all readily enough
 admit. All that we can do is to note so flagrant a case, as a striking
 example of the common artifices of the time. One other point we may
 note. The fervour and dexterity with which Diderot made what he knew
 to be the worse appear the better cause, make a still more striking
 example of his astonishing dramatic power of throwing himself, as
 dialectician, casuist, sophist, into a false and illusive part.</p>

 <p>Turning from the philosophical to the political or social group of
 articles, we find little to add to what has been said in the previous
 section. One of the most excellent essays in this group is that on
 Luxury. Diderot opens ingeniously with a list of the propositions that
 state the supposed evils of luxury, and under each proposition he
 places the most striking case that he can find in history of its
 falseness. He goes through the same process with the propositions
 asserting the gains of luxury to society. Having thus effectually
 disposed of any wholesale way of dealing with the subject, he proceeds
 to make a number of observations on the gains and drawbacks of luxury;
 these are full of sense and freedom from commonplace. Such articles as
 <i>Pouvoir, Souverain, Autorité</i>, do little more than tell over
 again the old unhistoric story about a society surrendering a portion
 of its sovereign power to some individual or dynasty to hold in trust.
 It is worth remarking how little democratic were Diderot and his
 school in any Jacobinical, or anarchic, or even more respectable
 modern sense. There is in Diderot's contributions many a firm and
 manly plea for the self-respect of the common people, but not more
 than once or twice is there a syllable of the disorder which smoulders
 under the pages of Rousseau. Thus: "When the dwellers among the fields
 are well treated, the number of proprietors insensibly grows greater,
 the extreme distance and the vile dependence of poor on rich grow
 less; hence the people have courage, force of soul, and strength of
 body; they love their country, they respect the magistrates, they are
 attached to a prince, to an order, and to laws to which they owe their
 peace and well-being. And you will no longer see the son of the
 honourable tiller of the soil so ready to quit the noble calling of
 his forefathers, nor so ready to go and sully himself with the
 liveries and with the contempt of the man of wealth."<a name=
 "FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

 <p>No one can find fault with democratic sentiment of this kind, nor
 with the generous commonplaces of the moralist, about virtue being the
 only claim to honour, and vice the only true source of shame and
 inferiority. But neither Diderot nor Voltaire ever allowed himself to
 flatter the crowd for qualities which the crowd can scarcely possess.
 The little article on Multitude seems merely inserted for the sake of
 buffeting unwarranted pretensions. "Distrust the judgment of the
 multitude in all matters of reasoning and philosophy; there its voice
 is the voice of malice, folly, inhumanity, irrationality, and
 prejudice. Distrust it again in things that suppose much knowledge or
 a fine taste. The multitude is ignorant and dulled. Distrust it in
 morality; it is not capable of strong and generous actions; it rather
 wonders at such actions than approves them; heroism is almost madness
 in its eyes. Distrust it in the things of sentiment; is delicacy of
 sentiment so common a thing that you can accord it to the multitude?
 In what then is the multitude right? In everything, but only at the
 end of a very long time, because then it has become an echo, repeating
 the judgment of a small number of sensible men who shape the judgment
 of posterity for it beforehand. If you have on your side the testimony
 of your conscience, and against you that of the multitude, take
 comfort and be assured that time does justice." It is far from being a
 universal gift among men of letters and others to unite this
 fastidious estimation of the incapacity of the crowd in the higher
 provinces of the intellectual judgment, with a fervid desire that the
 life of the crowd should be made worthy of self-respecting men.</p>

 <p>The same hand that wrote the defiance of the populace that has just
 been quoted, wrote also this short article on Misery: "There are few
 souls so firm that misery does not in the long run cast them down and
 degrade them. The poor common people are incredibly stupid. I know not
 what false dazzling prestige closes their eyes to their present
 wretchedness, and to the still deeper wretchedness that awaits the
 years of old age. Misery is the mother of great crimes. It is the
 sovereigns who make the miserable, and it is they who shall answer in
 this world and the other for the crimes that misery has
 committed."</p>

 <p>So far as the mechanism of government is concerned, Diderot writes
 much as Montesquieu had done. Under the head of <i>Représentants</i>
 he proclaims the advantages, not exactly of government by a
 representative assembly, but of assisting and advising the royal
 government by means of such an assembly. There is no thought of
 universal suffrage. "<i>It is property that makes the citizen</i>;
 every man who has possessions in the state is interested in the state,
 and whatever be the rank that particular conventions may assign to
 him, it is always as a proprietor; it is by reason of his possessions
 that he ought to speak, and that he acquires the right of having
 himself represented." Yet this very definite statement does not save
 him from the standing difficulty of a democratic philosophy of
 politics. Nor can it be reconciled in point of logic with other
 propositions to which Diderot commits himself in the same article. For
 instance, he says that "no order of citizens is capable of stipulating
 for all; if one order had the right, it would very soon come to
 stipulate only for itself; each class ought to be represented by men
 who know its condition and its needs; <i>these needs are only well
 known to those who actually feel them</i>." But then, in that case,
 the poorest classes are those who have most need of direct
 representation; they are the most numerous, their needs are sharpest,
 they are the classes to which war, consumption of national capital and
 way of expending national income, equal laws, judicial administration,
 and the other concerns of a legislative assembly, come most close. The
 problem is to reconcile the sore interests of the multitude with the
 ignorance and the temper imputed in Diderot's own description of
 them.</p>

 <p>An interesting study might be made, if the limits of our subject
 permitted such a digression, on the new political ideas which a
 century's experience in England, France, Germany, the American Union,
 has added to the publicist's stock. Diderot's article on the
 Legislator is a curious mixture of views which political thinkers have
 left behind, with views which the most enlightened statesmen have
 taken up. There is much talk after the fashion of Jean Jacques
 Rousseau about the admirable legislation of Lycurgus at Sparta, the
 philosophical government of the great empire of China, and the fine
 spirit of the institutions of Peru. We perceive that the same
 influences which made Rousseau's political sentimentalism so popular
 also brought even strong heads like Diderot to believe in the
 unbounded power of a government to mould men at its will, and to
 impose institutions at discretion. The idea that it is the main
 function of a government to make its people virtuous, is generally as
 strong in Diderot as it was in Rousseau, and as it became in
 Robespierre. He admires the emperors of China, because their edicts
 are as the exhortation of a father to his children. All edicts, he
 says, ought to instruct and to exhort as much as they command. Yet two
 years after the Encyclopædia was finished (1774), when Turgot prefaced
 his reforming edicts by elaborate and reasoned statements of the
 grounds for them, it was found that his prefaces caused greater
 provocation than the very laws that they introduced.</p>

 <p>Apart from the common form of enthusiasm for the "sublime
 legislation" of countries which the writer really knew nothing about,
 the article on the Legislator has some points worth noticing. We have
 seen how Diderot made the possession of property the true note of
 citizenship, and of a claim to share in the government. But he did not
 pay property this compliment for nothing. It is, he says, the business
 of the legislator to do his best to make up to mankind for the loss of
 that equality which was one of the comforts that men surrendered when
 they gave up the state of nature. Hence the legislator ought to take
 care that no one shall reach a position of extreme opulence otherwise
 than by an industry that enriches the state. "He must take care that
 the charges of society shall fall upon the rich, who enjoy the
 advantages of society." Even those who agree with Diderot, and are
 ready to vote for a graduated income-tax, will admit that he comes to
 his conclusion without knowing or reflecting about either the serious
 arguments for it, or the serious objections against it.</p>

 <p>What is really interesting in this long article is its anticipation
 of those ideas which in England we associate with the name of Cobden.
 "All the men of all lands have become necessary to one another for the
 exchange of the fruits of industry and the products of the soil.
 Commerce is a new bond among men. Every nation has an interest in
 these days in the preservation by every other nation of its wealth,
 its industry, its banks, its luxury, its agriculture. The ruin of
 Leipsic, of Lisbon, and of Lima has led to bankruptcies on all the
 exchanges of Europe, and has affected the fortunes of many millions of
 persons."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> In the same spirit he
 foresees the decline of patriotism in its older and narrower sense,
 and the predominance of the international over the national sentiment.
 "All nations now have sufficiently just ideas of their neighbours, and
 consequently they have less enthusiasm for their country than in the
 old days of ignorance. There is little enthusiasm where there is much
 light; enthusiasm is nearly always the emotion of a soul that is more
 passionate than it is instructed. By comparing among all nations laws
 with laws, talents with talents, and manners with manners, nations
 will find so little reason to prefer themselves to others, that if
 they preserve for their own country that love which is the fruit of
 personal interest, at least they will lose that enthusiasm which is
 the fruit of an exclusive self-esteem."</p>

 <p>Yet Diderot had the perspicacity to discern the drawbacks to such a
 revolution in the conditions of social climate. "Commerce, like
 enlightenment, lessens ferocity, but also, just as enlightenment takes
 away the enthusiasm of self-esteem, so perhaps commerce takes away the
 enthusiasm of virtue. It gradually extinguishes the spirit of
 magnanimous disinterestedness, and replaces it by that of hard
 justice. By turning men's minds rather to use than beauty, to prudence
 rather than to greatness, it may be that it injures the strength, the
 generosity, the nobleness of manners."</p>

 <p>All this, whether it comes to much or little, is at least more true
 than Diderot's assurance that henceforth for any nation in Europe to
 make conquests must be a moral impossibility. Napoleon Bonaparte was
 then a child in arms. Whether his career was on the whole a fulfilment
 or a contradiction of Diderot's proposition, may be disputed.</p>

 <p>And so our sketch of the great book must at length end. Let us make
 one concluding remark. Is it not surprising that a man of Diderot's
 speculative boldness and power should have failed to rise from the
 mechanical arrangement of thought and knowledge, up to some higher and
 more commanding conception of the relation between himself in the
 eighteenth century, or ourselves in the nineteenth, and all those
 great systems of thought, method, and belief, which in various epochs
 and over different spaces of the globe have given to men working
 answers to the questions that their leading spirits were moved to put
 to themselves and to the iron universe around them? We constantly feel
 how near Diderot is to the point of view that would have brought
 light. We feel how very nearly ready he was to see the mental
 experiences of the race in east and west, not as superstition,
 degradation, grovelling error, but as aspects of intellectual effort
 and aspiration richly worthy of human interest and scientific
 consideration, and in their aim as well as in their substance all of
 one piece with the newest science and the last voices of religious or
 anti-religious development. Diderot was the one member of the party of
 Philosophers who was capable of grasping such a thought. If this
 guiding idea of the unity of the intellectual history of man, and the
 organic integrity of thought, had happily come into Diderot's mind, we
 should have had an Encyclopædia indeed; a survey and representation of
 all the questions and answers of the world, such as would in itself
 have suggested what questions are best worth putting, and at the same
 time have furnished its own answers.</p>

 <p>For this the moment was not yet. An urgent social task lay before
 France and before Europe; it could not be postponed until the thinkers
 had worked out a scheme of philosophic completeness. The thinkers did
 not seriously make any effort after this completeness. The
 Encyclopædia was the most serious attempt, and it did not wholly fail.
 As I replace in my shelves this mountain of volumes, "dusky and huge,
 enlarging on the sight," I have a presentiment that their pages will
 seldom again be disturbed by me or by others. They served a great
 purpose a hundred years ago. They are now a monumental ruin, clothed
 with all the profuse associations of history. It is no Ozymandias of
 Egypt, king of kings, whose wrecked shape of stone and sterile
 memories we contemplate. We think rather of the gray and crumbling
 walls of an ancient stronghold reared by the endeavour of stout hands
 and faithful, whence in its own day and generation a band once went
 forth against barbarous hordes, to strike a blow for humanity and
 truth.</p>

 SOCIAL LIFE (1759-1770).</h2>

 <p>Any one must be ignorant of the facts who supposes that the men of
 the eighteenth century who did not believe in God, and were as little
 continent as King David, were therefore no better than the reckless
 vagabonds of Grub Street. Diderot, after he had once settled down to
 his huge task, became a very orderly person. It is true that he had an
 attachment to a lady who was not his wife. Marriage was in those days,
 among the courtiers and the encyclopædic circle, too habitually
 regarded as merely an official relation. Provided that there was no
 official desertion, and no scandal, the world had nothing to say.
 Diderot was no worse than his neighbours, though we may well be sorry
 that a man of his generous sympathies and fine impulse was no better
 than his neighbours. Mademoiselle Voland, after proper deduction made
 for the manners of the time, was of a respectable and sentimental
 type. Her family were of good position; she lived with her mother and
 sisters, and Diderot was on good terms with them all. We have a
 glimpse of the characteristics of the three ladies in a little
 dialogue between Diderot and some one whom he met, and who happened to
 have made their acquaintance. "He informed me that he had passed three
 months in the country where you are.—<i>Three months</i>, said he,
 <i>is more than one needs to go mad about Madame Le
 Gendre</i>.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id=
 "FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class=
 "fnanchor">[192]</a>—True, but then she is so reserved.—<i>I scarcely
 know any woman with such an amount of self-respect</i>.—She is quite
 right.—<i>Madame Voland is a woman of rare merit</i>.—Yes, and her
 eldest daughter?—<i>She has the cleverness of a very devil</i>.—She is
 very clever, no doubt; but what I especially like is her frankness. I
 would lay a wager that she has never told a voluntary lie since she
 came to years of discretion."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id=
 "FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class=
 "fnanchor">[193]</a> The relations between Diderot and Sophie Voland
 were therefore not at all on the common footing of a low amour with a
 coarse or frivolous woman of the world. All the proprieties of
 appearance were scrupulously observed. Their mutual passion, though
 once not wholly without its gallantries, soon took on that worthy and
 decorous quality into which the ardour of valiant youth is reluctantly
 softened by middle age, when we gravely comfort it with names of
 philosophical compliment.</p>

 <p>One of the most interesting of all the documentary memorials of the
 century is to be found in the letters which Diderot wrote to
 Mademoiselle Voland. No doubt has ever been thrown on the authenticity
 of these letters, and they bear ample evidence of genuineness, so far
 as the substance of them is concerned, in their characteristic style.
 They were first published in 1830, from manuscripts sold to the
 bookseller the year before by a certain French man of letters,
 Jeudy-Dugour by name. He became a naturalised Russian, changed his
 name to Gouroff, and died in the position of councillor of state and
 director of the university of St. Petersburg. How he came by any
 papers of Diderot it is impossible to guess. It is assumed that when
 Mademoiselle Voland died her family gave his letters and other papers
 back to Diderot. These, along with other documents, are supposed to
 have been given by Diderot to Grimm. Thence they went to the Library
 of the Hermitage at St. Petersburg. Whether Jeudy-Dugour sold copies
 or originals, and whether he made the copies, if copies they were,
 from the Library, which was, however, rigorously closed during the
 reign of Nicholas I., are literary secrets which it is impossible to
 fathom. So far as Diderot is concerned, some of the spirit of
 mystification that haunted literature in the eighteenth century still
 hovers about it in the nineteenth. This we shall presently find in a
 still more interesting monument of Diderot than even his letters to
 Mademoiselle Voland.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id=
 "FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class=
 "fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

 <p>They are not a continuous series. It was only when either Diderot
 was absent from Paris, or his correspondent was away at her mother's
 house in the country, that letter-writing was necessary. Diderot
 appears to have written to her openly and without disguise. The
 letters of Mademoiselle Voland in reply were for obvious reasons not
 sent to Diderot's house, but under cover to the office of Damilaville,
 so well known to the reader of Voltaire's correspondence. Damilaville
 was a commissioner in one of the revenue departments, and it is one
 among many instances of the connivance between authority and its foes,
 that most of the letters and packets of Voltaire, Diderot, and the
 rest of the group, should have been taken in, sent out, guarded, and
 franked by the head of a government office. The trouble that
 Damilaville willingly took in order to serve his friends is another
 example of what we have already remarked as the singular amiability
 and affectionate solicitude of those times. "Think of Damilaville's
 attention," says Diderot on one occasion: "to-day is Sunday, and he
 was obliged to leave his office. He was sure that I should come this
 evening, for I never fail when I hope for a letter from you. He left
 the key with two candles on a table, and between the two candles your
 little letter, and a pleasant note of his own." And by the light of
 the candles Diderot at once wrote a long answer.<a name=
 "FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

 <p>We need not wonder if much is said in these letters of tardy
 couriers, missing answers, intolerable absences, dreary partings,
 delicious anticipations. All these are the old eternal talk of men and
 women, ever since the world began; without them we should hardly know
 that we are reading the words of man to woman. They are in our present
 case only the setting of a curiously frank and open picture of a man's
 life.</p>

 <p>It is held by some that one of the best means of giving the sense
 of a little fixity to lives that are but as the evanescent fabric of a
 dream and the shadow of smoke, is to secure stability of topographical
 centre by abiding in the same house. Diderot is one of the few who
 complied with this condition. For thirty years he occupied the fourth
 and fifth floors of a house which was still standing not long ago, at
 the corner of the Rue Saint Benoit by the Rue Taranne, in that Paris
 which our tourists leave unexplored, but which is nevertheless the
 true Paris of the eighteenth century. Of the equipment of his room we
 have a charming picture by the hand of its occupant. It occurs in his
 playful Regrets on My Old Dressing-gown, so rich in happy and
 delightful touches.</p>

 <p>"What induced me to part with it? It was made for me; I was made
 for it. It moulded itself to all the turns and outlines of my body
 without fretting me. I was picturesque and beautiful; its successor,
 so stiff, so heavy, makes a mere mannikin of me. There was no want to
 which, its complaisance did not lend itself, for indigence is ever
 obsequious. Was a book covered with dust, one of the lappets offered
 itself to wipe the dust away. Did the thick ink refuse to flow from
 the pen, it offered a fold. You saw traced in the long black lines
 upon it how many a service it had rendered me. Those long lines
 announced the man of letters, the writer, the workman. And now I have
 all the mien of a rich idler; you know not who I may be. I was the
 absolute master of my old robe; I am the slave of my new one. The
 dragon that guarded the golden fleece was not more restless than I.
 Care wraps me about.</p>

 <p>"The old man who has delivered himself up bound hand and foot to
 the caprices of a young giddypate, says from morning to night: Ah,
 where is my old, my kind housekeeper? What demon possessed me the day
 that I dismissed her for this creature? Then he sighs, he weeps. I do
 not weep nor sigh; but at every moment I say: Cursed be the man who
 invented the art of making common stuff precious by dyeing it scarlet!
 Cursed be the costly robe that I stand in awe of! Where is my old, my
 humble, my obliging piece of homespun?</p>

 <p>"That is not all, my friend. Hearken to the ravages of luxury—of a
 luxury that must needs be consistent with itself. My old gown was at
 one with the things about me. A straw-bottomed chair, a wooden table,
 a deal shelf that held a few books, and three or four engravings,
 dimmed by smoke, without a frame, nailed at the four corners to the
 wall. Among the engravings three or four casts in plaster were hung
 up; they formed, with my old dressing-gown, the most harmonious
 indigence. All has become discord. No more <i>ensemble</i>, no more
 unity, no more beauty.</p>

 <p>"The woman who comes into the house of a widower, the minister who
 steps into the place of a statesman in disgrace, the molinist bishop
 who gets hold of the diocese of a jansenist bishop—none of these
 people cause more trouble than the intruding scarlet has caused to
 me.</p>

 <p>"I can bear without disgust the sight of a peasant-woman. The bit
 of coarse canvas that covers her head, the hair falling about her
 cheeks, the rags that only half cover her, the poor short skirt that
 goes no more than half-way down her legs, the naked feet covered with
 mud —all these things do not wound me; 'tis the image of a condition
 that I respect, 'tis the sign and summary of a state that is
 inevitable, that is woful, and that I pity with all my heart. But my
 gorge rises, and in spite of the scented air that follows her, I turn
 my eyes from the courtesan, whose fine lace head-gear and torn cuffs,
 white stockings and worn-out shoes, show me the misery of the day in
 company with the opulence of last night. Such would my house have
 been, if the imperious scarlet had not forced all into harmony with
 itself. I had two engravings that were not without merit, Poussin's
 Manna in the Wilderness, and the same painter's Esther before
 Ahasuerus; the one is driven out in shame by some old man of Rubens's,
 the Fall of the Manna is scattered to the winds by a Storm of
 Vernet's. The old straw chair is banished to the ante-room by a
 luxurious thing of morocco. Homer, Virgil, Horace, Cicero, have been
 taken from their shelf and shut up in a case of grand marqueterie
 work, an asylum worthier of them than of me. The wooden table still
 held its ground, protected by a vast pile of pamphlets and papers
 heaped pell-mell upon it; they seemed as if they would long protect it
 from its doom. Yet one day that too was mastered by fate, and in spite
 of my idleness pamphlets and papers went to arrange themselves in the
 shelves of a costly bureau....It was thus that the edifying retreat of
 the philosopher became transformed into the scandalous cabinet of the
 farmer-general. Thus I too am insulting the national misery.</p>

 <p>"Of my early mediocrity there remained only a list carpet. The
 shabby carpet hardly matches with my luxury. I feel it. But I have
 sworn and I swear that I will keep this carpet, as the peasant, who
 was raised from the hut to the palace of his sovereign, still kept his
 wooden shoes. When in a morning, clad in the sumptuous scarlet, I
 enter my room, if I lower my eyes I perceive my old list carpet; it
 recalls to me my early state, and rising pride stands checked. No, my
 friend, I am not corrupted. My door is open as ever to want; it finds
 me affable as ever; I listen to its tale, I counsel, I pity, I succour
 it." ...</p>

 <p>Yet the interior of Socrates-Diderot was as little blessed by
 domestic sympathy as the interior of the older and greater Socrates.
 Of course Diderot was far enough from being faultless. His wife is
 described by Rousseau as a shrew and a scold. It is too plain that she
 was so; sullen to her husband, impatient with her children, and
 exacting and unreasonable with her servants.<a name="FNanchor_196_196"
 id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class=
 "fnanchor">[196]</a> We cannot pretend accurately to divide the blame.
 The companionship was very dreary, and the picture grievous and most
 afflicting to our thoughts. Diderot returns in the evening from
 Holbach's, throws his carpet-bag in at the door, flies off to seek a
 letter from Mademoiselle Voland, writes one to her, gets back to his
 house at midnight, finds his daughter ill, puts cheerful and cordial
 questions to his wife, she replies with a tartness that drives him
 back into silence.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id=
 "FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class=
 "fnanchor">[197]</a> Another time the scene is violent. A torrent of
 injustice and unreasonableness flows over him for two long hours, and
 he wonders what the woman will profit, after she has made him burst a
 blood-vessel; he groans in anguish, "Ah, how hard life seems to me to
 bear! How many a time would I accept the end of it with joy!"<a name=
 "FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> So sharp are the goads
 in a divided house; so sorely, with ache and smart and deep-welling
 tears, do men and women rend into shreds the fine web of one another's
 lives. But the pity of it, O the pity of it!</p>

 <p>There are many brighter intervals which make one willing to suppose
 that if the wife had been a little more patient, more tolerant, more
 cheerful, less severely addicted to her sterile superstition, there
 might have been somewhat more happiness in the house. One misery of
 the present social ideal of women is that, while it keeps them so
 systematically ignorant, superstitious, and narrow, it leaves them
 without humility. "Be content," said the great John Wesley to his
 froward wife, "be content to be a private insignificant person, known
 and loved by God and me. Of what importance is your character to
 mankind? If you was buried just now, or if you had never lived, what
 loss would it be to the cause of God?" This energetic remonstrance can
 hardly be said to exhaust the matter. Still it puts a wholesome side
 of the case which Madame Diderot missed, and which better persons are
 likely to miss, so long as the exclusion of women, by common opinion
 or by law, from an active participation in the settlement of great
 issues, makes them indifferent to all interests outside domestic
 egoism, and egoistic and personal religion. Brighter intervals shone
 in the household. "I announced my departure," writes Diderot, "for
 next Tuesday. At the first word I saw the faces both of mother and
 daughter fall. The child had a compliment for my fête-day all ready,
 and it would not do to let her waste the trouble of having learnt it.
 The mother had projected a grand dinner for Sunday. Well, we arranged
 everything perfectly. I made my journey, and came back to be harangued
 and feasted. The poor child made her little speech in the most
 bewitching way. In the middle there came some hard words, so she
 stopped and said to me, 'My papa, 'tis because my two front teeth have
 come out'—as was true. Then she went on. At the end, as she had a posy
 to give me, and it could not be found, she stopped a second time to
 say to me—'Here's the worst of the tale; my pinks have got lost.' Then
 she started off in search of her flowers. We dined in great style. My
 wife had got all her friends together. I was very gay, eating,
 drinking, and doing the honours of my table to perfection. On rising
 from table I stayed among them and played cards instead of going out.
 I saw them all off between eleven and twelve: I was charming, and if
 you only knew with whom; what physiognomies, what folk, what
 talk!"</p>

 <p>Another time the child, whispering in his ear, asks why her mother
 bade her not remind him that the morrow was the mother's fête-day. The
 presence of the blithe all-hoping young, looking on with innocent
 unconscious eyes at the veiled tragedy of love turned to bitter
 discord, gives to such scenes their last touch of piteousness.
 Diderot, however, observed the day, and presented a bouquet which was
 neither well or ill received. At the birthday dinner the master of the
 house presided. "If you had been behind the curtains, you would have
 said to yourself, how can all this gossip and twaddle find a place in
 the same head with certain ideas! And in truth I was charming, and
 played the fool to a marvel."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id=
 "FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class=
 "fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

 <p>In the midst of distractions great and small, was an indomitable
 industry. "I tell you," he wrote, "and I tell all men, when you are
 ill at ease with yourself, instantly set about some good work. In
 busying myself to soothe the trouble of another, I forget my own." He
 was assiduous in teaching his daughter, though he complained that her
 mother crushed out in a day what it had taken him a month to implant.
 The booksellers found him the most cheerful and strenuous bondsman
 that ever booksellers had. He would pass a whole month without a day's
 break, working ten hours every day at the revision of proof-sheets.
 Sometimes he remains a whole week without leaving his workroom. He
 wears out his eyes over plates and diagrams, bristling with figures
 and letters, and with no more refreshing thought in the midst of this
 sore toil than that insult, persecution, torment, trickery, will be
 the fruit of it. He not only spent whole days bent over his desk,
 until he had a feeling as of burning flame within him; he also worked
 through the hours of the night. On one of these occasions, worn out
 with fatigue and weariness, he fell asleep with his head on his desk;
 the light fell down among his papers, and he awoke to find half the
 books and papers on the desk burnt to ashes. "I kept my own counsel
 about it," he writes, "because a single hint of such an accident would
 have robbed my wife of sleep for the rest of her life."<a name=
 "FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

 <p>His favourite form of holiday was a visit to Holbach's country
 house at Grandval. Here he spent some six weeks or more nearly every
 autumn after 1759. The manner of life there was delightful to him.
 There was perfect freedom, the mistress of the house neither rendering
 strict duties of ceremony nor exacting them. Diderot used to rise at
 six or at eight, and remain in his own room until one, reading,
 writing, meditating. Nobody was more exquisitely sensible than Diderot
 to the charm of loitering over books, "over those authors," as he
 said, "who ravish us from ourselves, in whose hands nature has placed
 a fairy wand, with which they no sooner touch us, than straightway we
 forget the evils of life, the darkness lifts from our souls, and we
 are reconciled to existence."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id=
 "FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class=
 "fnanchor">[201]</a> The musing suggestiveness of reading when we read
 only for reading's sake, and not for reproduction nor direct use, was
 as delightful to our laborious drudge as to others, but he could
 indulge himself with little of this sweet idleness. It was in harder
 labour that he passed most of his mornings. These hours of work
 achieved, he dressed and went down among his friends. Then came the
 mid-day dinner, which was sumptuous; host and guests both ate and
 drank more than was good for their health. After a short siesta,
 towards four o'clock they took their sticks and went forth to walk,
 among woods, over ploughed fields, up hills, through quagmires,
 delighting in nature. As they went, they talked of history, or
 politics, or chemistry, of literature, or physics, or morality. At
 sundown they returned, to find lights and cards on the tables, and
 they made parties of piquet, interrupted by supper. At half-past ten
 the game ends, they chat until eleven, and in half an hour more they
 are all fast asleep.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id=
 "FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class=
 "fnanchor">[202]</a> Each day was like the next; industry, gaiety,
 bodily comfort, mental activity, diversifying the hours. Grimm was
 often there, "the most French of all the Germans," and Galiani, the
 most nimble-witted of men, inexhaustible in story, inimitable in
 pantomimic narration, and yet with the keenest intellectual
 penetration shining through all his Neapolitan prank and buffoonery.
 Holbach cared most for the physical sciences. Marmontel brought a vein
 of sentimentalism, and Helvétius a vein of cynical formalism. Diderot
 played Socrates, Panurge, Pantophile; questioning, instructing,
 combining; pouring out knowledge and suggestion, full of interest in
 every subject, sympathetic with every vein, relishing alike the newest
 philosophic hardihood, the last too merry mood of Holbach's
 mother-in-law, the freshest piece of news brought by a traveller. It
 was not at Grandval that he found life hard to bear, or would have
 accepted its close with joy. And indeed if one could by miracle be
 transported back into the sixth decade of that dead century for a
 single day, perhaps one might choose that such a day should be passed
 among the energetic and vivid men who walked of an afternoon among the
 fields and woods of Grandval.</p>

 <p>The unblushing grossness of speech which even the ladies of the
 party permitted themselves cannot be reproduced in the decorous print
 of our age. It is nothing less than inconceivable to us how Diderot
 can have brought himself to write down, in letters addressed to a
 woman of good education and decent manners, some of the talk that went
 on at Grandval. The coarsest schoolboy of these days would wince at
 such shameless freedoms. But it would be wrong to forget the allowance
 that must be made for differences in point of fashion. Diderot, for
 instance, in these very letters is wonderfully frank in his exposure
 of the details of his health. He describes his indigestions, and other
 more indescribable obstructions to happiness, as freely as Cicero
 wrote about the dysentery which punished him, when, after he had
 resisted oysters and lampreys at supper, he yielded to a dish of beet
 and mallow so dressed with pot-herbs, <i>ut nil posset esse
 suavius</i>. Whatever men could say to one another or to their
 surgeons they saw no harm in saying to women. We have to remember how
 Sir Walter Scott's great-aunt, about the very time when Diderot was
 writing to Mademoiselle Voland, had heard Mrs. Aphra Behn's books read
 aloud for the amusement of large circles, consisting of the first and
 most creditable society in London. We think of Swift, in an earlier
 period of the century, enclosing to Stella some recklessly gross
 verses of his own upon Bolingbroke, and habitually writing to fine
 ladies in a way that Falstaff might have thought too bad for Doll
 Tearsheet. In saying that these coarse impurities are only points of
 manners, we are as far as possible from meaning that they are on that
 account unimportant. But it is childish to waste our time in
 censorious judgment on the individual who does no worse than represent
 a ruling type. We can only note the difference and pass on.</p>

 <p>A characteristic trait in this rural life is Diderot's passion for
 high winds. They gave him a transport, and to hear the storm at night,
 tossing the trees, drenching the ground with rain, and filling the air
 with the bass of its hoarse ground-tones, was one of his keenest
 delights.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Yet Diderot was not of
 those in whom the feeling for the great effects of nature has
 something of savagery. He was above all things human, and the human
 lot was the central source of his innermost meditations. In the midst
 of gossip is constantly interpolated some passage of fine reflection
 on life—reflection as sincere, as real, coming as spontaneously from
 the writer's inmost mood and genuine sentiment, as little tainted
 either by affectation or by commonness, as ever passed through the
 mind of a man. Some of these are too characteristic to be omitted, and
 there is so little of what is exquisite in the flavour of Diderot's
 style, that he perhaps suffers less from the clumsiness of translation
 than writers of finer colour or more stirring melody. One of these
 passages is as follows:—</p>

 <p>"The last news from Paris has made the Baron anxious, as he has
 considerable sums in royal securities. He said to his wife: 'Listen,
 my friend; if this is going on, I put down the carriage, I buy you a
 good cloak and a good parasol, and for the rest of our days we will
 bless the minister for ridding us of horses, lackeys, coachmen,
 ladies'-maids, cooks, great dinner-parties, false friends, tiresome
 bores, and all the other privileges of opulence.' And for my part I
 began to think, that for a man without a wife or child, or any of
 those connections that make us long for money, and never leave any
 superfluity, it would be almost indifferent whether he were poor or
 rich. This paradox comes of the equality that I discover among various
 conditions of life, and in the little difference that I allow, in
 point of happiness, between the master of the house and the
 hall-porter. If I am sound in mind and body, if I have worth and a
 pure conscience, if I know the true from the false, if I avoid evil
 and do good, if I feel the dignity of my being, if nothing lowers me
 in my own eyes, then people may call me what they will, <i>My
 Lord,</i> or <i>Sirrah</i>. To do what is good, to know what is
 true—that is what distinguishes one man from another; the rest is
 nothing. The duration of life is so short, its true needs are so
 narrow, and when we go away, it all matters so little whether we have
 been somebody or nobody. When the end comes, all that you want is a
 sorry piece of canvas and four deal boards. In the morning I hear the
 labourers under my window. Scarce has the day dawned before they are
 at work with spade and barrow, delving and wheeling. They munch a
 crust of black bread; they quench their thirst at the flowing stream;
 at noon they snatch an hour of sleep on the hard ground. They are
 cheerful; they sing as they work; they exchange their good broad
 pleasantries with one another; they shout with laughter. At sundown
 they go home to find their children naked round a smoke-blackened
 hearth, a woman hideous and dirty, and their lot is neither worse nor
 better than mine. I came down from my room in bad spirits; I heard
 talk about the public misery; I sat down to a table full of good cheer
 without an appetite; I had a stomach overloaded with the dainties of
 the day before; I grasped a stick and set out for a walk to find
 relief; I returned to play cards, and cheat the heavy-weighing hours.
 I had a friend of whom I could not hear; I was far from a woman whom I
 sighed for. Troubles in the country, troubles in the town, troubles
 everywhere. He who knows not trouble is not to be counted among the
 children of men. All gets paid off in time; the good by the evil, evil
 by good, and life is naught. Perhaps to-morrow night or Monday morning
 we may go to pass a day in town; so I shall see the woman for whom I
 sighed, and recover the man of whom I could not hear. But I shall lose
 them the next day; and the more I feel the happiness of being with

 <p>It is not often that we find such active benevolence as Diderot's,
 in conjunction with such a vein of philosophy as follows:—</p>

 <p>"Ah, what a fine comedy this world would be, if only one had not to
 play a part in it; if one existed, for instance, in some point of
 space, in that interval of the celestial orbs where the gods of
 Epicurus slumber, far, far away, whence one could see this globe, on
 which we strut so big, about the size of a pumpkin, and whence one
 could watch all the airs and tricks of that two-footed mite who calls
 itself man. I would fain only look at the scenes of life in reduced
 size, so that those which are stamped with atrocity may be brought
 down to an inch in space, and to actors half a line high. But how
 bizarre, that our sense of revolt against injustice is in the ratio of
 the space and the mass. I am furious if a large animal unjustly
 attacks another. I feel nothing at all if it is two atoms that tear
 and rend. How our senses affect our morality. There is a fine text for
 philosophising!"<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id=

 <p>"What I see every day of physic and physicians does not much
 heighten my opinion of them. To come into the world in imbecility, in
 the midst of anguish and cries; to be the toy of ignorance, of error,
 of necessity, of sickness, of malice, of all passions; to return step
 by step to that imbecility whence one sprang; from the moment when we
 lisp our first words, down to the moment when we mumble the words of
 our dotage, to live among rascals and charlatans of every kind; to lie
 expiring between a man who feels your pulse, and another man who frets
 and wearies your head; not to know whence one comes, nor why one has
 come, nor whither one is going—that is what we call the greatest gift
 of our parents and of nature—human life."<a name="FNanchor_206_206"

 <p>These sombre meditations hardly represent Diderot's habitual vein;
 they are rather a reaction and a relief from the busy intensity with
 which he watches the scene, and is constantly putting interrogatories
 to human life, as day by day its motley circumstance passes before his
 eyes. We should scarcely suspect from his frequent repetitions of the
 mournful eternal chorus of the nullity of man and the vanity of all
 the things that are under the sun, how alert a watch he kept on
 incident and character, with what keen and open ear he listened for
 any curious note of pain, or voice of fine emotion, or odd perversity
 of fate. All this he does, not in the hard temper of a Balzac, not
 with the calm or pride of a Goethe, but with an overflowing fulness of
 spontaneous and uncontrollable sympathy. He is a sentimentalist in the
 rationalistic century, not with the sentimentalism of misanthropy,
 such as fired or soured Rousseau, but social, large-hearted,
 many-sided, careless of the wise rigours of morality. He is never
 callous nor neutral; on the contrary, he is always approving or
 disapproving, but not from the standards of the ethical text-books.
 The casuistry of feeling is of everlasting interest to him, and he is
 never tired of inventing imaginary cases, or pondering real ones, in
 which pliant feeling is invoked against the narrowness of duty. These
 are mostly in a kind of matter which modern taste hardly allows us to
 reproduce; nor, after all, is there much to be gained by turning the
 sanctities of human relationship, with all their immeasurable bliss,
 their immeasurable woe, into the playthings of an idle dialectic. It
 is pleasanter, and for us English not less instructive than pleasant,
 to see this dreaming, restless, thrice ingenious spirit, half Titan of
 the skies, half gnome of the lower earth, entering joyously or
 pitifully into the simple charm and natural tenderness of life as it
 comes and passes. Nothing delights him more than to hear or to tell
 such a story as this of Madame D'Epinay. She had given a small lad
 eighteen sous for a day's work. At night he went home without a
 farthing. When his mother asked him whether they had given him nothing
 for his work, he said No. The mother found out that this was untrue,
 and insisted on knowing what had become of the eighteen sous. The poor
 little creature had given them to an alehouse-keeper, where his father
 had been drinking all day; and so he had spared the worthy man a rough
 scene with his wife when he got home.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id=

 <p>From the pathos of kindly youth to the grace of lovable age the
 step is not far. "To-day I have dined with a charming woman, who is
 only eighty years old. She is full of health and cheerfulness; her
 soul is still all gentleness and tenderness. She talks of love and
 friendship with the fire and sensibility of a girl of twenty. There
 were three men of us at table with her; she said to us, 'My friends, a
 delicate conversation, a true and passionate look, a tear, a touched
 expression, those are the good things of the world; as for all
 besides, it is hardly worth talking of. There are certain things that
 were said to me when I was young, and that I remember to this day, and
 any one of those words is to be preferred before ten glorious deeds:
 by my faith, I believe if I heard them even now, my old heart would
 beat the quicker.' 'Madame, the reason is that your heart has grown no
 older.' 'No, my son, you are right; it is as young as ever. It is not
 for having kept me alive so long that I thank God, but for having kept
 me kind-hearted, gentle, and full of feeling.'"<a name=
 "FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> All this was after</p>

 <p>Diderot's own heart, and he declares such a conversation to be
 worth more than all the hours of talk on politics and philosophy that
 he had been having a few days before with some English friends. We may
 understand how, as we shall presently see, a member of a society that
 could relish the beauty of such a scene, would be likely to think
 Englishmen hard, surly, and cheerless.</p>

 <p>His letters constantly offer us sensible and imaginative
 reflection. He amused himself in some country village by talking to an
 old man of eighty. "I love children and old men; the latter seem to me
 like some singular creatures that have been spared by caprice of
 fate." He meets some old schoolfellows at Langres, nearly all the rest
 having gone: "Well, there are two things that warn us of our end, and
 set us musing—old ruins, and the short duration of those who began
 life with us." He is taken by a host over-devoted to such joys, to
 walk among dung-heaps. "After all," he says, "it ought not to offend
 one's sense. To an honest nose that has preserved its natural
 innocence, 'tis not a goat, but a bemusked and ambre-scented woman,
 who smelleth ill."</p>

 <p>"When I compare our friendships to our antipathies, I find that the
 first are thin, small, pinched; we know how to hate, but we do not
 know how to love."</p>

 <p>"A poet who becomes idle, does excellently well to be idle; he
 ought to be sure that it is not industry that fails, but that his gift
 is departing from him."</p>

 <p>"Comfort the miserable; that is the true way to console yourself
 for my absence. I recollect saying to the Baron, when he lost his
 first wife, and was sure that there was not another day's happiness
 left for him in this world, 'Hasten out of doors, seek out the
 wretched, console them, and then you will pity yourself, if you
 dare.'"<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href=

 <p>"An infinitude of tyrannical things interpose between us and the
 duties of love and friendship; and we do nothing aright. A man is
 neither free for his ambition, nor free for his taste, nor free for
 his passion. And so we all live discontented with ourselves. One of
 the great inconveniences of the state of society is the multitude of
 our occupations and, above all, the levity with which we make
 engagements to dispose of all our future happiness. We marry, we go
 into business, we have children, all before we have common
 sense."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href=

 <p>After some equivocal speculations as to the conduct of a woman who,
 by the surrender of herself for a quarter of an hour to the desires of
 a powerful minister, wins an appointment for her husband and bread for
 her six children, he exclaims: "In truth, I think Nature heeds neither
 good nor evil; she is wholly wrapped up in two objects, the
 preservation of the individual and the propagation of the
 species."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> True; but the moral
 distinction between right and wrong is so much wrung from the forces
 that Diderot here calls Nature.</p>

 <p>The intellectual excitement in which he lived and the energy with
 which he promoted it, sought relief either in calm or else in the play
 of sensibility. "A delicious repose," he writes in one of his most
 harassed moments, "a sweet book to read, a walk in some open and
 solitary spot, a conversation in which one discloses all one's heart,
 a strong emotion that brings the tears to one's eyes and makes the
 heart beat faster, whether it comes of some tale of generous action,
 or of a sentiment of tenderness, of health, of gaiety, of liberty, of
 indolence—there is the true happiness, nor shall I ever know any
 other."</p>

 <p><i>A Point in Rhetoric.</i>—"Towards six in the evening the party
 broke up. I remained alone with D., and as we were talking about the
 Eloges on Descartes that had been sent in to the Academy, I made two
 remarks that pleased him upon eloquence. One, that it is a mistake to
 try to stir the passions before convincing the reason, and that the
 pathetic remains without effect, when it is not prepared by the
 syllogism. Second, that after the orator had touched me keenly, I
 could not endure that he should break in upon this melting of the soul
 with some violent stroke: that the pathetic insists on being followed
 by something moderate, weak, vague, that should leave room for no
 contention on my part."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id=

 <p><i>Holbach's Impressions of England.</i>—"The Baron has returned
 from England. He started with the pleasantest anticipations, he had a
 most agreeable reception, he had excellent health, and yet he has
 returned out of humour and discontented; discontented with the
 country, which he found neither as populous nor as well cultivated as
 people say; discontented with the buildings, that are nearly all
 bizarre and Gothic; with the gardens, where the affectation of
 imitating nature is worse than the monotonous symmetry of art; with
 the taste that heaps up in the palaces what is first-rate, what is
 good, what is bad, what is detestable, all pell-mell. He is disgusted
 at the amusements, which have the air of religious ceremonies; with
 the men, on whose countenances you never see confidence, friendship,
 gaiety, sociability, but on every face the inscription, <i>'What is
 there in common between me and you?'</i>; disgusted with the great
 people, who are gloomy, cold, proud, haughty, and vain; and with the
 small people, who are hard, insolent, and barbarous. The only thing
 that I have heard him praise is the facility of travel: he says there
 is not a village, even on a cross-road, where you do not find four or
 five post-chaises and a score of horses ready to start.... There is no
 public education. The colleges—sumptuous buildings—palaces to be
 compared to the Tuileries, are occupied by rich idlers, who sleep and
 get drunk one part of the day, and the rest they spend in training,
 clumsily enough, a parcel of uncouth lads to be clergymen.... In the
 fine places that have been built for public amusements, you could hear
 a mouse run. A hundred stiff and silent women walk round and round an
 orchestra that is set up in the middle. The Baron compares these
 circuits to the seven processions of the Egyptians round the tomb of
 Osiris. A charming <i>mot</i> of my good friend Garrick, is that
 London is good for the English, but Paris is good for all the
 world.... There is a great mania for conversions and missionaries. Mr.
 Hume told me a story which will let you know what to think of these
 pretended conversions of cannibals and Hurons. A minister thought he
 had done a great stroke in this line; he had the vanity to wish to
 show his proselyte, and brought him to London. They question his
 little Huron, and he answers to perfection. They take him to church,
 and administer the sacrament, where, as you know, the communion is in
 both kinds. Afterwards, the minister says to him, 'Well, my son, do
 you not feel yourself more animated with the love of God? Does not the
 grace of the sacrament work within you? Is not all your soul warmed?'
 'Yes,' says the Huron: 'the wine does one good, but I think it would
 have done still better if it had been brandy.'"<a name=

 <p><i>Two Cases of Conscience</i>.—"The curé said that unhappy lovers
 always talked about dying, but that it was very rare to find one who
 kept his word; still he had seen one case. It was that of a young man
 of family, called Soulpse. He fell in love with a young lady of beauty
 and of good character, but without money, and belonging to a
 dishonoured family. Her father was in the galleys for forgery. The
 young man, who foresaw all the opposition, and all the good grounds
 for opposition, that he would have to encounter among his family, did
 all that he could to cure himself of his passion; but when he was
 assured of the uselessness of his efforts, he plucked up courage to
 open the matter to his parents, who wearied themselves with
 remonstrances. Our lover suddenly stopped them short, saying, 'I know
 all that you have to say against me; I cannot disapprove of your
 reasons, which I should be the first to urge against my own son, if I
 had one. But consider whether you would rather have me dead or badly
 married; for it is certain that if I do not marry the woman that I
 love, I shall die of it.' They treated this speech as it deserved; the
 result does not affect that. The young man fell sick, faded from day
 to day, and died. 'But, Curé,' said I, 'in the place of the father,
 what would you have done?' 'I would have called my son; I would have
 said: Soulpse has been your name hitherto; never forget that it is
 yours no more; and call yourself by what other name you please. Here
 is your lawful share of our property; marry the woman you love, so far
 from here that I may never hear speak of you again, and God bless you.
 'For my part,' said old Madame D'Esclavelles, 'if I had been the
 mother of the young madman, I would have done exactly as his father
 did, and let him die.' And upon this there was a tremendous division
 of opinion, and an uproar that made the room ring again.</p>

 <p>"The dispute lasted a long time, and would be going on now if the
 cure had not broken it off by putting to us another case. A young
 priest, discontented with his profession, flees to England,
 apostatises, marries according to the law, and has children. After a
 certain time he longs for his native country; he comes back to France
 with his children and his wife. After that, again, he is stricken by
 remorse; he returns to his religion, has scruples about his marriage,
 and thinks of separating from his wife. He opens his heart to our
 curé, who finds the case very embarrassing, and not venturing to
 decide it, refers him to casuists and lawyers. They all decide that he
 cannot, with a sure conscience, remain with his wife. When the
 separation, which the wife opposed with all her might, was about to be
 legally effected—rather against the wishes of our curé—the husband
 fell dangerously ill. When he knew that he could not recover, he said
 to the curé: 'My friend, I wish to make public amends for my
 backsliding, to receive the sacraments, and to die in the hospital; be
 kind enough to have me taken there.' 'I will take care to do no such
 thing,' the curé replied to him. 'This woman is innocent; she married
 you according to law; she knew nothing of the obstacles that existed.
 And these children, what share have they in your sin? You are the only
 wrongdoer, and it is they who are to be punished! Your wife will be
 disgraced, your children will be declared illegitimate, and what is
 the gain of it all?' And the good curé stuck to his text. He confessed
 his man, the illness grew worse, he administered the last sacraments.
 The man died, and his wife and children remained in possession of the
 titles they had. We all approved the curé's wisdom, and Grimm insisted
 on having his portrait taken."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id=

 greater astronomers, greater geometers, than these good people; but
 they understand better than we the science of good sense and virtue;

 <p>"A little adventure has just happened here that proves that all our
 fine sermons on intolerance have as yet produced but poor fruit. A
 young man of respectable birth, some say apprentice to an apothecary,
 others to a grocer, took it into his head to go through a course of
 chemistry; his master consented, on condition that he should pay for
 board; the lad agreed. At the end of the quarter the master demanded
 the money, and it was paid. Soon after, another demand from the
 master; the apprentice replied that he barely owed a single quarter.
 The master denied that the first quarter had been paid. The affair was
 taken into court. The master is put on his oath, and swears. He had no
 sooner perjured himself than the apprentice produced his receipt, and
 the master was straightway fined and disgraced. He was a scoundrel who
 deserved it, but the apprentice was a rash fellow, whose victory was
 bought at a price dearer than life. He had received, in payment or
 otherwise, from some colporteur, two copies of <i>Christianity
 Unveiled</i>, and one of them he had sold to his master. The master
 informs against him. The colporteur, his wife, and his apprentice, are
 all three arrested, and they have just been pilloried, whipped, and
 branded, and the apprentice condemned to nine years of the galleys,
 the colporteur to five years, and the woman to the hospital for
 life.... Do you see the meaning of this judgment? A colporteur brings
 me a prohibited book. If I buy more than one copy, I am declared to be
 encouraging unlawful trading, and exposed to a frightful prosecution.

 to guess why it is placed under the ban in the judgment I am telling

 saying that it was better to have to do with a single wild beast,
 which one could avoid, than with a band of little subaltern tigers who
 are incessantly getting between your legs.... To return to those two
 unfortunate wretches whom they have condemned to the galleys. When
 they come out, what will become of them? There will be nothing left
 for them to do, save to turn highway robbers. The ignominious

 <p><i>Method and Genius: an Apologue.</i>—"There was a question
 between Grimm and M. Le Roy of creative genius and co-ordinating
 method. Grimm detests method; according to him, it is the pedantry of
 letters. Those who can only arrange, would do as well to remain idle;
 those who can only get instruction from what has been arranged, would
 do as well to remain ignorant. What necessity is there for so many
 people knowing anything else besides their trade? They said a great
 many things that I don't report to you, and they would be saying
 things still, if the Abbé Galiani had not interrupted them:</p>

 <p>'My friends, I remember a fable: pray listen to it. One day, in the
 depths of a forest, a dispute arose between a Nightingale and a
 Cuckoo. Each prizes its own gift. What bird, said the Cuckoo, has a
 song so easy, so simple, so natural, so measured, as mine?</p>

 <p>What bird, said the Nightingale, has a song sweeter, more varied,
 more brilliant, more touching, than mine?</p>

 <p><i>The Cuckoo:</i> I say few things, but they are things of weight,
 of order, and people retain them.</p>

 <p><i>The Nightingale:</i> I love to use my voice, but I am always
 fresh, and I never weary. I enchant the woods; the Cuckoo makes them
 dismal. He is so attached to the lessons of his mother, that he would
 not dare to venture a single note that he had not taken from her. Now
 for me, I recognise no master. I laugh at rules. What comparison
 between his pedantic method and my glorious bursts?</p>

 <p>The Cuckoo tried several times to interrupt the Nightingale. But
 nightingales always go on singing, and never listen; that is rather
 their weakness. Ours, carried away by his ideas, followed them with
 rapidity, without paying the least attention to the answers of his
 rival.</p>

 <p>So after some talk and counter-talk, they agreed to refer their
 quarrel to the judgment of a third animal. But where were they to find
 this third, equally competent and impartial? It is not so easy to find
 a good judge. They sought on every side. As they crossed a meadow,
 they spied an Ass, one of the gravest and most solemn that ever was
 seen. Since the creation of the world, no ass had ever had such long
 ears. 'Ah,' said the Cuckoo, 'our luck is excellent; our quarrel is a
 matter of ears: here is our judge. God Almighty made him for the very
 purpose!'</p>

 <p>The Ass went on browsing. He little thought that one day he would
 have to decide a question of music. But Providence amuses itself with
 this and many another thing. Our two birds bow very low, compliment
 him upon his gravity and his judgment, explain the subject of their
 dispute, and beseech him, with all deference, to listen to their case
 and decide.</p>

 <p>But the Ass, hardly turning his heavy head and without losing a
 single toothsome blade, makes them a sign with his ears that he is
 hungry, and that he does not hold his court to-day. The birds persist;
 the Ass goes on browsing. At last his hunger was appeased. There were
 some trees planted by the edge of the meadow. 'Now, if you like,' said
 he, 'you go there, I will follow; you shall sing, I will digest; I
 will listen, and I'll give you my opinion.'</p>

 <p>The birds instantly fly away, and perch on branches. The Ass
 follows them with the air and the step of a chief justice crossing
 Westminster Hall: he stretches himself flat on the ground, and says,
 'Begin, the court listens.'</p>

 <p>Says the Cuckoo: 'My lord, there is not a word to lose. I beg of
 you to seize carefully the character of my singing; above all things,
 deign, my lord, to mark its artifice and its method.' Then filling its
 throat, and flapping its wings at each note, it sang out, 'Coucou,
 coucou, coucou, coucou, coucou, coucou.' And after having combined
 this in every possible way, it fell silent.</p>

 <p>The Nightingale, without any prelude, pours forth his voice at
 once, launches into the most daring modulations, pursues the freshest
 and most delicate melodies, cadences, pauses, and trills; now you
 heard the notes murmuring at the bottom of its throat, like the ripple
 of the brook as it loses itself among the pebbles; now you heard them
 rising and gradually swelling and filling the air, and lingering
 long-drawn in the skies. It was tender, glad, brilliant, pathetic; but
 his music was not made for everybody.</p>

 <p>Carried away by enthusiasm, he would be singing still; but the Ass,
 who had already yawned more than once, stopped him, and said, 'I
 suspect that all you have been singing there is uncommonly fine, but I
 don't understand a word of it: it strikes me as bizarre, incoherent,
 and confused. It may be you are more scientific than your rival; but
 he is more methodic than you, and for my part, I'm for method.'</p>

 <p>"And then the abbé, addressing M. Le Roy, and pointing to Grimm
 with his finger: 'There,' he said, 'is the nightingale, and you the
 cuckoo; and I am the ass, who decide in your favour. Good-night.'</p>

 <p>"The abbés stories are capital, but he acts in a way that makes
 them better still. You would have died with laughing to see him
 stretch his neck into the air, and imitate the fine note of the
 nightingale, then fill his throat, and take up the hoarse tone for the
 cuckoo; and all that naturally, and without effort. He is pantomime
 from head to foot."<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id=

 <p><i>Conversation.</i>—"'Tis a singular thing, conversation,
 especially when the company is tolerably large. Look at the roundabout
 circuits we took; the dreams of a patient in delirium are not more
 incongruous. Still, just as there is nothing absolutely unconnected in
 the head either of a man who dreams, or of a lunatic, so all hangs
 together in conversation; but it would often be extremely hard to find
 the imperceptible links that have brought so many disparate ideas
 together. A man lets fall a word which he detaches from what has gone
 before, and what has followed in his head; another does the same, and
 then let him catch the thread who can. A single physical quality may
 lead the mind that is engaged upon it to an infinity of different
 things. Take a colour—yellow, for instance; gold is yellow, silk is
 yellow, care is yellow, bile is yellow, straw is yellow; to how many
 other threads does not this thread answer? Madness, dreaming, the
 rambling of conversation, all consist in passing from one object to
 another, through the medium of some common quality."<a name=

 to come back. If they would give me an immortality of bliss for a
 single day of purgatory, I would not take it. The best that can befall
 us is to cease to be.'</p>

 <p>"This set me musing, and it seemed to me that so long as I was in
 good health I should agree with Father Hoop; but that, at the last
 instant, I should perhaps purchase the happiness of living again by a
 thousand, nay, ten thousand, years of hell. Ah, my dear, if I thought
 that I should see you again, I should soon persuade myself of what a
 daughter once succeeded in persuading her father on his deathbed. He
 was an old usurer; a priest had sworn to him that he would be damned
 unless he made restitution. He resolved to comply, and calling his
 daughter to his bedside, said to her: 'My child, you thought I should
 leave you very rich, and so I should; but the man there insists that I
 shall burn in hell-fire for ever, if I die without making
 restitution.' 'You are talking nonsense, father, with your restitution
 and your damnation,' the daughter answered; 'with your character I you
 will not have been damned ten years, before you will be perfectly used
 to it.'</p>

 <p>"This struck him as true, and he died without making
 restitution.</p>

 <p>"And so behold us launched into a discussion on life and death, on
 the world and its alleged Creator.</p>

 <p>"Some one remarked that whether there be a God or no, it is
 impossible to introduce that device either into nature or into a
 discussion without darkening it.</p>

 <p>"Another said that if a single supposition explained all the
 phenomena, it would not follow from this that it is true; for who
 knows whether the general order only allows of one reason? What, then,
 must we think of a supposition which, so far from resolving the one
 difficulty for the sake of which people imagined it, only makes an
 infinity of others spring up from it?</p>

 <p>"I believe, my dear, that our chat by the fireside still amuses
 you; so I go on.</p>

 <p>"Among these difficulties is one that has been proposed ever since
 the world has been a world; 'tis that men suffer without having
 deserved suffering. There has been no answer to it yet. 'Tis the
 incompatibility of physical and moral evil with the nature of the
 Eternal Being. This is how the dilemma is put: it is either impotence
 or bad will; impotence, if he wished to hinder evil and could not; bad
 will, if he could have hindered it and did not will it. A child would
 understand that. It is this that has led people to imagine the fault
 of the first father of us all, original sin, future rewards and
 punishments, the incarnation, immortality, the two principles of the
 Manicheans, the Ormuzd and Ahriman of the Persians, the doctrine of
 emanations, the empire of light and darkness, metempsychosis,
 optimism, and other absurdities that have found credit among the
 different nations of the earth, where there is always to be found some
 hollow vision of a dream, by way of answer to a clear, precise, and
 definite fact.</p>

 <p>"On such occasions what is the part of good sense? Why, the part
 that we took: whatever the optimists may say, we will reply to them
 that if the universe could not exist without sensible creatures, nor
 sensible creatures without pain, there was nothing to do but to leave
 chaos at peace. They had got on very well for a whole eternity without
 any such piece of folly.</p>

 <p>"The world a piece of folly! Ah, my dear, a glorious folly for all
 that! 'Tis, according to some of the inhabitants of Malabar, one of
 the seventy-four comedies with which the Eternal amuses himself.</p>

 <p>"Leibnitz, the founder of optimism, tells somewhere how there was
 in the Temple of Memphis a high pyramid of globes placed one above the
 others; how a priest, being asked by a traveller about this pyramid
 and its globes, made answer that these were all the possible worlds,
 and that the most perfect of them all was at the summit; how the
 traveller, curious to see this most perfect of all possible worlds,
 mounted to the top of the pyramid, and the first thing that caught his
 eyes, as they turned towards the globe at the summit, was Tarquin
 outraging Lucretia."<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id=

 <p>Almost every letter reminds us that we are in the very height of
 the disputing, arguing, rationalistic century. Diderot delighted in
 this kind of argument, as Socrates or Dr. Johnson delighted in it. He
 was above all others the archetype and representative of the passion
 for moralising, analysing, and philosophising which made the epoch
 what it was; but the rest of the world was all in the same vein. If he
 came to Paris in a coach from the country, he found a young lady in
 it, eager to demonstrate that serious passions are nowadays merely
 ridiculous; that people only promise themselves pleasure, which they
 find or not, as the case may be; that thus they spare themselves all
 the broken oaths of old days. "I took the liberty of saying that I was
 still a man of those old days. '<i>So much the worse for you</i>,' she
 said, '<i>you either deceive or are deceived, and one is as bad as the
 other</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id=
 "FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class=
 "fnanchor">[222]</a> If Grimm and Madame d'Epinay and he were
 together, they discussed ethics from morning to night; Diderot always
 on the side of the view that made most for the dignity and worth of
 human nature. Grimm is described on one of these occasions as having
 rather displeased Madame d'Epinay: "He was not sufficiently ready to
 disapprove the remark of a man of our acquaintance, who said that it
 was right to observe the most scrupulous probity with one's friends,
 but that it was mere dupery to treat other people better than they
 would treat us. We maintained, she and I, that it was right and
 necessary to be honest and good with all the world without
 distinction."<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id=
 "FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class=
 "fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

 <p>Here is another picture of discussion, with an introduction that is
 thoroughly characteristic of Diderot's temper:</p>

 <p>"This man looks at the human race only on its dark side. He does
 not believe in virtuous actions; he disparages them, and denies them.
 If he tells a story, it is always about something scandalous and
 abominable. I have just told you of the two women of my acquaintance,
 of whom he took occasion to speak as ill as he could to Madame Le
 Gendre. They have their defects, no doubt; but they have also their
 good qualities. Why be silent about the good qualities, and only pick
 out the defects? There is in all that a kind of envy that wounds me—me
 who read men as I read authors, and who never burden my memory except
 with things that are good to know and good to imitate. The
 conversation between Suard and Madame Le Gendre had been very
 vivacious. They sought the reasons why persons of sensibility were so
 readily, so strongly, so deliciously moved at the story of a good
 action. Suard maintained that it was due to a sixth sense that nature
 had endowed us with, to judge the good and the beautiful. They pressed
 to know what I thought of it. I answered that this sixth sense was a
 chimæra; that all was the result of experience in us; that we learnt
 from our earliest infancy what it was in our instinct to hide or to
 show. When the motives of our actions, our judgments, our
 demonstrations, are present to us, we have what is called science;
 when they are not present to our memory, we have only what is called
 taste, instinct, and tact. The reasons for showing ourselves sensible
 to the recital of good actions are numberless: we reveal a quality
 that is worthy of infinite esteem; we promise to others our esteem, if
 ever they deserve it by any uncommon or worthy piece of conduct....
 Independently of all these views of interest, we have a notion of
 order, and a taste for order, which we cannot resist, and which drags
 us along in spite of ourselves. Every fine action implies sacrifice;
 and it is impossible for us not to pay our homage to
 self-sacrifice"—and so forth.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id=
 "FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class=
 "fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

 <p>Alas, all these endless debates and dialogues lacked the
 inspiration and the charm with which the genius of a Plato could adorn
 the narrowest quibble between Socrates and a Sophist. "Diderot," said
 Mademoiselle de Lespinasse, "is an extraordinary man; he is out of his
 place in society; he was meant for the chief of a sect, a Greek
 philosopher, instructing youth. He pleases me greatly, but his manner
 does not touch my soul."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id=
 "FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class=
 "fnanchor">[225]</a> And we understand this. People disputed what
 virtue is, but the dispute failed in that undefined spirit which makes
 men love and adore virtue. Goodness is surrounded with no spacious
 beauty, it is clothed with none of the high associations of
 spontaneous piety. The discussion seems close, stifling, and airless.
 Yet ages of loftier speech and greater spirituality have not always
 been so favourable to the affections or to the attachments of life. In
 amiability that society has never been surpassed; in sincerity of
 mutual sympathy and kindliness of mutual regard. The common
 irregularity of morals was seen to be perfectly compatible not merely
 with a desire to please, but with an honest anxiety to serve.</p>

 <p>Of the thorough excellence of Diderot's heart, of his friendliness
 and unwearied helpfulness, time would fail us to tell. Men's
 conceptions of friendship differ as widely as their conceptions of
 other things. Some look to friendship for absolute exemption from all
 criticism, and for a mutual admiration without limit or conditions.
 Others mistake it for the right of excessive criticism, in season and
 out of season.</p>

 <p>Diderot was content to take friendship as the right, the duty, or
 the privilege of rendering services, without thought of requiring
 either them, or gratitude for them, back in return. This we must
 confess to be rare. No man that ever lived showed more sterling
 interest in furthering the affairs of others around him. He seemed to
 admit every claim on his time, his purse, and his talents. A stranger
 called upon him one day, and begged Diderot to write for him a puffing
 advertisement of a new pomatum. Diderot with a laugh sat down and
 wrote what was wanted. The graver occasions of life found him no less
 ready. Damilaville lost one of his children, and his wife was
 inconsolable. It was Diderot who was summoned, and who cheerfully went
 for days together to soothe and divert her mind. For his correspondent
 and for us he makes the tedium of his story beautiful by recalling the
 fine saying of a grief-stricken woman in Metastasio, when they tried
 to console her by the example of Abraham, who was ready even to slay
 his son at the command of God: <i>Ah, God would never have given such
 an order to his mother!</i></p>

 <p>The abbé Le Monnier wrote the worst verses that ever were read, a
 play that was instantly damned, and a translation of Terence that came
 into the world dead. But bad writers are always the most shameless
 intruders on the time of good critics, and we find Diderot willingly
 spending hours over the abbé's handwriting, which was as wretched as
 what he wrote, and then spending hours more in offering critical
 observations on verses that were only fit to be thrown into the fire.
 The abbé, being absent from Paris and falling short of money,
 requested Diderot to sell for him his copy of the Encyclopædia. "I
 have sold your Encyclopædia," said Diderot, "but did not get so much
 as I expected, for the rumour spread abroad by those scoundrels of
 Swiss booksellers, that they were going to issue a revised edition,
 has done us some harm. Send for the nine hundred and fifty livres
 (about £40) that belong to you, and if that is not enough for your
 expenses, besides the drawer that holds your money is another that
 holds mine. I don't know how much there is, but I will count it all at
 your disposal."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id=
 "FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class=
 "fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

 <p>One Jodin, again, was a literary hack who had been employed on the
 Encyclopædia. He died, leaving a foolish and extravagant widow, and a
 perverse and violent daughter. The latter went on to the stage, and
 Diderot took as much trouble in advising her, in seeking appointments
 for her, in executing her commissions, in investing her earnings, in
 dealing with her relatives, as if he had been her own father. If his
 counsels on her art are admirable, there is something that moves us
 with more than admiration in the good sense, the right feeling, the
 worthiness of his counsels on conduct. And Diderot did not merely
 moralise at large. All that he says is real, pointed, and apt for
 circumstance and person. The petulant damsel to whom they were
 addressed would not be likely to yawn over the sharp remonstrances,
 the vigorous plain speaking, the downright honesty and visible
 sincerity of his friendliness. It appears that she had sense enough
 not to be offended with the frankness of her father's old employer,
 for after he has plainly told her that she is violent, rude, vain, and
 not always too truthful, she still writes to him from Warsaw, from
 Dresden, from Bordeaux, praying him to procure a certain bracelet for
 her, to arrange her mother's affairs, to find a good investment for
 twelve thousand francs. When the mother was in the depths of
 indigence, Diderot insisted that she should take her meals at his own
 table. And all this for no other reason than that the troublesome pair
 had been thrown in his way by the chance of human circumstance, and
 needed help which he was able, not without sacrifice, to give.
 Mademoiselle Jodin was hardly worthy of so good a friend. Her parents
 were Protestants, and as she was a convert, she enjoyed a pension of
 some eight pounds a year. That did not prevent her from one day
 indulging in some too sprightly sallies, as the host was carried along
 the street. For this she was put into prison, and that is our last
 glimpse of the light creature.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id=
 "FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class=
 "fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

 <p>Men knew how to be as wrong-headed and as graceless as women. We
 have already mentioned the name of Landois in connection with
 Diderot's article on Liberty. Landois seems to have been a marvel of
 unreasonableness, but he was a needy man of letters, and that was
 enough to make Diderot ready to bear with him and to succour him. He
 wound up an epistle abounding, after the manner of the worthless
 failures of the world, in reproaches and grievances against his
 benefactor, with a cool request about a manuscript that was full of
 dangerous matter. "Why, that," replied Diderot, "is a work that might
 well be the ruin of me! And it is after you have on two separate
 occasions charged me with the most atrocious and deliberate offences
 towards you, that you now propose that I should revise and print your
 work! You know that I have a wife and child, that I am a marked man,
 that you are putting me into the class of hardened offenders; never
 mind, you don't think of one of these things. You take me for an
 imbecile, or else you are one. But you are no imbecile.... I see
 through men's designs, and often enough I lend myself to them, without
 deigning to disabuse them as to the stupidity which they impute to me.
 It is enough if I perceive in their design some great service for
 them, and not an excess of inconvenience for myself. It is not I who
 am the fool, so often as people take me for one." Diderot then seems
 half to forget to whom he is writing and pours out what reads like a
 long soliloquy on morals, conduct, and the philosophy of life. He
 insists that man, with all his high-flying freedom of will, is but a
 little link in a great chain of events. He is a creature to be
 modified from without; hence the good effects of example, discourse,
 education, pleasures, pains, greatness, misery. Hence a sort of
 philosophy of commiseration, which attaches us strongly to the good,
 and irritates us no more against the bad than against a wind-storm
 that fills our eyes with dust. If you adopt such principles as these,
 they will reconcile you with others and yourself; you will neither
 praise nor blame yourself for what you are. To reproach others with
 nothing, to repent yourself of nothing—these are the two first steps
 towards wisdom; this is the philosophy that reconciles us with the
 human race and with life.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id=
 "FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class=
 "fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

 <p>When he was in the very midst of all the toil and strife that the
 Encyclopædia brought upon him, he could not refuse to spend three
 whole days in working like a galley-slave at an account of an
 important discovery that had been made by some worthy people with whom
 he was acquainted slightly. "But while I was busy about their affairs,
 my own are at a standstill. I write to you from Le Breton's, with a
 mass of uncorrected proofs before me, and the printers crying out for
 them. Still Grimm must be right, when he says that time is not a thing
 of which we are free to dispose at our own fancy; that we owe it first
 and foremost to our friends, our relations, our daily duties; and that
 in the lavish profusion of our time on people who are indifferent,
 there is nothing less than vice."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id=
 "FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class=
 "fnanchor">[229]</a> Yet in spite of Grimm's most just remonstrance,
 the lavish profusion always went on as before.</p>

 <p>There was one man, and only one man, for whose perverse and
 intractable spirit Diderot's most friendly patience, helpfulness, and
 devotion, were no match. I have already, in dealing with
 Rousseau,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> said as much of the
 quarrel which he picked with Diderot as the matter requires, and it
 would be superfluous to go over the ground again from another side.
 Whether we listen to Rousseau's story or to Diderot's story, our
 judgment on what happened remains unchanged. We have already seen how
 warm and close an intimacy subsisted between them in the days when
 Diderot was a prisoner at Vincennes (1749). When Rousseau made up his
 mind to leave Paris and turn hermit (1756), there was a loud outcry
 from the social group at Holbach's. They said to him, in the least
 theological dialect of their day, what Sir Walter Scott had said to
 Ballantyne when Ballantyne thought of leaving Edinburgh, that, "when
 our Saviour himself was to be led into temptation, the first thing the
 Devil thought of was to get him into the wilderness." Diderot
 remonstrated rather more loudly than Rousseau's other friends, but
 there was no breach, and even no coolness. What sort of humours were
 bred by solitude in Rousseau's wayward mind we know, and the
 Confessions tell us how for a year and a half he was silently brooding
 over fancied slights and perhaps real pieces of heedlessness. Grimm,
 who was Diderot's closest friend next to Mademoiselle Voland, despised
 Rousseau, and Rousseau detested Grimm. "Grimm," he one day said to a
 disciple, "is the only man whom I have ever been able to hate." Madame
 d'Epinay was compelled to go to Geneva for her health, and Grimm
 easily persuaded Diderot that Rousseau was bound by all the ties of
 gratitude to accompany his benefactress on the expedition. Diderot
 wrote to the hermit a very strong letter to this effect: it made
 Rousseau furious. He declined the urgent counsel, he quarrelled
 outright and violently with Grimm, and after an angry and confusing
 interview with Diderot, all intercourse ceased with him also. "That
 man," wrote Diderot, on the evening of this, their last interview,
 "intrudes into my work; he fills me with trouble, and I feel as if I
 were haunted by a damned soul at my side. May I never see him more; he
 would make me believe in devils and hell."<a name="FNanchor_231_231"
 id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class=
 "fnanchor">[231]</a> And writing afterwards to some friend at Geneva,
 he recalls the days when he used to pour out the talk of intimacy
 "with the man who has buried himself at the bottom of a wood, where
 his soul has been soured and his moral nature has been corrupted. Yet
 how I pity him! Imagine that I used to love him, that I remember those
 old days of friendship, and that I see him now with crime on one side
 and remorse on the other, with deep waters in front of him. He will
 many a time be the torment of my thought; our common friends have
 judged between him and me; I have kept them all, and to him there
 remains not one."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id=
 "FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class=
 "fnanchor">[232]</a> It was not in Diderot's nature to bear malice,
 and when eight years later Rousseau passed through Paris on his
 ill-starred way to England and the</p>

 <p>Derbyshire hills, Diderot described the great pleasure that a visit
 from Rousseau would give to him. "Ah, I do well," he says, "not to let
 the access to my heart be too easy; when anybody has once found a
 place in it, he does not leave it without making a grievous rent; 'tis
 a wound that can never be thoroughly cauterised."<a name=
 "FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

 <p>It is needless to remind the neutral reader that Rousseau uses
 exactly the same kind of language about his heart. For this is the
 worst of sentimentalism, that it is so readily bent into a
 substitution of indulgence to oneself for upright and manly judgment
 about others. Still we may willingly grant that in the present rupture
 of a long friendship, it was not Diderot who was the real offender.
 <i>Too many honest people would be in the wrong</i>, he most truly
 said, <i>if Jean Jacques were in the right</i>.</p>

 <p>Of Grimm, I have already said elsewhere as much as is needful to be
 said.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> His judgment in matters
 of conduct and character was cool and rather hard, but it was
 generally sound. He had a keen eye for what was hollow in the
 pretensions of the society in which he lived. Above all, he had the
 keen eye of his countrymen for his own interest, and for the use which
 he could make of other people. The best thing that we know in his
 favour, is that he should have won the friendship of Diderot.
 Diderot's attachment to Grimm seems like an exaggeration of the
 excesses of the epoch of sentimentalism in Germany.</p>

 <p>He pines for a letter from him, as he pined for letters from
 Mademoiselle Voland. If Grimm had been absent for a few months, their
 meeting was like a scene in a melodrama. "With what ardour we
 enclasped one another. My heart was swimming. I could not speak a
 word, nor could he. We embraced without speaking, and I shed tears. We
 were not expecting him. We were all at dessert when he was announced,
 <i>'Here is M. Grimm.'</i> '<i>M. Grimm</i>,' I exclaimed, with a loud
 cry; and starting up, I ran to him and fell on his neck. He sat down,
 and ate a poor meal, you may be sure. As for me, I could not open my
 lips either to eat or to speak. He was next to me, and I kept pressing
 his hand and gazing at him."<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id=
 "FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class=
 "fnanchor">[235]</a> Mademoiselle Voland appears on some occasion to
 have compared Diderot with his friend. "No more comparison, I beseech
 you, my good friend, between Grimm and me. I console myself for his
 superiority by frankly recognising it. I am vain of the victory that I
 thus gain over my self-love, and you must not deprive me of that
 little advantage."<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id=
 "FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class=
 "fnanchor">[236]</a> Grimm, however, knew better than Diderot how to
 unite German sentimentalism with a steady selfishness. "I have just
 received from Grimm," writes good-natured Diderot, "a note that wounds
 my too sensitive spirit. I had promised to write him a few lines on
 the exhibition of pictures in the Salon; he writes to me that if it is
 not ready to-morrow, it will be of no use. I will be revenged for this
 kind of hardness, and in a way that becomes me. I worked all day
 yesterday, and all day to-day. I shall pass the night at work, and all
 to-morrow, and at nine o'clock he shall receive a volume of
 manuscript."<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id=
 "FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class=
 "fnanchor">[237]</a> We may doubt whether his German friend would feel
 the force of a rebuke so extremely convenient to himself.</p>

 <p>While Grimm was amusing himself at Madame d'Epinay's country house,
 Diderot was working at the literary correspondence which Grimm was
 accustomed to send to St. Petersburg and the courts of Germany. While
 Grimm was hunting pensions and honorary titles at Saxe-Gotha, or
 currying favour with Frederick and waiting for gold boxes at Potsdam,
 Diderot was labouring like any journeyman in writing on his behalf
 accounts and reviews of the books, good, bad, and indifferent, with
 which the Paris market teemed. When there were no new books to talk
 about, the ingenious man, with the resource of the born journalist,
 gave extracts from books that did not exist.<a name="FNanchor_238_238"
 id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class=
 "fnanchor">[238]</a> When we hear of Paris being the centre of
 European intelligence and literary activity, we may understand that
 these circular letters of Grimm and Diderot were the machinery by
 which the light of Paris was diffused among darker lands. It is not
 too much to say that no contemporary record so intelligent, so
 independent, so vigorous, so complete, exists of any other remarkable
 literary epoch.</p>

 <p>The abbé Raynal, of whom we shall have more to say in a later
 chapter, had founded this counterpart of a modern review in 1747, and
 he sent a copy of it in manuscript once a month to anybody who cared
 to pay three hundred francs a year. In 1753 Raynal had handed the
 business over to Grimm, and by him it was continued until 1790, twelve
 years beyond the life of Voltaire and of Rousseau, and six years after
 the death of the ablest, most original, and most ungrudging of all
 those who gave him their help.</p>

 <p>An interesting episode in Diderot's life brought him into direct
 relations with one of the two crowned patrons of the revolutionary
 literature, who were philosophers in profession and the most arbitrary
 of despots in their practice. Frederick the Great, whose literary
 taste was wholly in the vein of the conventional French classic, was
 never much interested by Diderot's writing, and felt little curiosity
 about him. Catherine of Russia was sufficiently an admirer of the
 Encyclopædia to be willing to serve its much-enduring builder. In
 1765, when the enterprise was in full course, Diderot was moved by a
 provident anxiety about the future of his daughter. He had no dower
 for her in case a suitor should present himself, and he had but a
 scanty substance to leave her in case of his own death. The income of
 the property which he inherited from his father was regularly handed
 to his wife for the maintenance of the household. His own earnings, as
 we have seen, were of no considerable amount. There are men of
 letters, he wrote in 1767, to whom their industry has brought as much
 as twenty, thirty, eighty, or even a hundred thousand francs. As for
 himself, he thought that perhaps the fruit of his literary occupations
 would come to about forty thousand crowns, or some five thousand
 pounds sterling. "One could not amass wealth," he said pensively, and
 his words are of grievous generality for the literary tribe, "but one
 could acquire ease and comfort, if only these sums were not spread
 over so many years, did not vanish away as they were gathered in, and
 had not all been scattered and spent by the time that years had
 multiplied, wants, grown more numerous, eyes grown dim, and mind
 become blunted and worn."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id=

 "fnanchor">[239]</a> This was his own case. His earnings were never
 thriftily husbanded. Diderot could not deny himself a book or an
 engraving that struck his fancy, though he was quite willing to make a
 present of it to any appreciative admirer the day after he had bought
 it. He was extravagant in hiring a hackney-coach where another person
 would have gone on foot, and not seldom the coachman stood for half a
 day at the door, while the heedless passenger was expatiating within
 upon truth, virtue, and the fine arts, unconscious of the passing
 hours and the swollen reckoning. Hence, when the time came, there were
 no savings. We have to take a man with the defects of his qualities,
 and as Diderot would not have been Diderot if he had taken time to
 save money, there is no more to be said.</p>

 <p>When it became his duty to provide for his daughter, between 1763
 and 1765, he resolved to sell his library. Through Grimm, Diderot's
 position reached the ears of the Empress of Russia. Her agent was
 instructed to buy the library at the price fixed by its possessor, and
 Diderot received sixteen thousand livres, a sum equal to something
 more than seven hundred pounds sterling of that day. The Empress added
 a handsome bounty to the bargain. She requested Diderot to consider
 himself the custodian of the new purchase on her behalf, and to
 receive a thousand livres a year for his pains. The salary was paid
 for fifty years in advance, and so Diderot drew at once what must have
 seemed to him the royal sum of between two and three thousand pounds
 sterling—a figure that would have to be trebled, or perhaps
 quadrupled, to convey its value in the money of our own day. We may
 wish for the honour of letters that Diderot had been able to preserve
 his independence. But pensions were the custom of the time. Voltaire,
 though a man of solid wealth, did not disdain an allowance from
 Frederick the Great, and complained shrilly because it was irregularly
 paid at the very time when he knew that Frederick was so short of
 money that he was driven to melt his plate. D'Alembert also had his
 pension from Berlin, and Grimm, as we have seen, picked up
 unconsidered trifles in half of the northern courts. Frederick offered
 an allowance to Rousseau, but that strange man, in whom so much that
 was simple, touching, and lofty, mingled with all that was wayward and
 perverse, declined to tax the king's strained finances.<a name=

 "#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

 <p>It would shed an instructive light upon authorship and the
 characters of famous men, if we could always know the relations
 between a writer and his booksellers. Diderot's point of view in
 considering the great modern enginery and processes of producing and
 selling books, was invariably, like his practice, that of a man of
 sound common sense and sterling integrity. We have seen in the
 previous chapter something of the difficulties of the trade in those
 days. The booksellers were a close guild of three hundred and sixty
 members, and the printers were limited to thirty-six. Their privileges
 brought them little fortune. They were of the lowest credit and
 repute, and most of them were hardly better than beggars. It was said
 that not a dozen out of the three hundred and sixty could afford to
 have more than one coat for his back. They were bound hand and foot by
 vexatious rules, and their market was gradually spoiled by a band of
 men whom they hated as interlopers, but whom the public had some
 reason to bless. No bookseller nor printer could open an establishment
 outside of the quarter of the University, or on the north side of the
 bridges. The restriction, which was as old as the introduction of
 printing into France, had its origin in the days when the visits of
 the royal inspectors to the presses and bookshops were constant and
 rigorous, and it saved the time of the officials to have all their
 business close to their hand. Inasmuch, however, as people insisted on
 having books, and as they did not always choose to be at the pains of
 making a long journey to the region of the booksellers' shops, hawkers
 sprang into existence. Men bought books or got them on credit from the
 booksellers, and carried them in a bag over their shoulders to the
 houses of likely customers, just as a peddler now carries laces and
 calico, cheap silks and trumpory jewellery, round the country
 villages. Even poor women filled their aprons with a few books, took
 them across the bridges, and knocked at people's doors. This would
 have been well enough in the eyes of the guild, if the hawkers had
 been content to buy from the legally patented booksellers. But they
 began secretly to turn publishers in a small way on their own account.
 Contraband was here, as always, the natural substitute for free trade.
 They both issued pirated editions of their own, and they became the
 great purchasers and distributors of the pirated editions that came in
 vast bales from Switzerland, from Holland, from the Pope's country of
 Avignon. To their craft or courage the public owed its copies of works
 whose circulation was forbidden by the government. The Persian Letters
 of Montesquieu was a prohibited book, but, for all that, there were a
 hundred editions of it before it had been published twenty years, and
 every schoolboy could find a copy on the quays for a dozen halfpence.
 Bayle's Thoughts on the Comet, Rousseau's Emilius and Heloïsa,
 Helvétius's L'Esprit, and a thousand other forbidden pieces were in
 every library, both public and private. The Social Contract, printed
 over and over again in endless editions, was sold for a shilling under
 the vestibule of the king's own palace. When the police were in
 earnest, the hawker ran horrible risks, as we saw a few pages further
 back; for these risks he recompensed himself by his prices. A
 prohibition by the authorities would send a book up within
 four-and-twenty hours from half a crown to a couple of louis. This
 only increased the public curiosity, quickened the demand, led to
 clandestine reprints, and extended the circulation of the book that
 was nominally suppressed. When the condemnation of a book was cried
 through the streets, the compositors said, "Good, another edition!"
 There was no favour that an unknown author could have asked from the
 magistrates so valuable to him as a little decree condemning his work
 to be torn up and burnt at the foot of the great staircase of the
 Palace of Justice.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id=
 "FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class=
 "fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

 <p>It was this practical impossibility of suppression that interested
 both the guild of publishers and the government in the conditions of
 the book trade. The former were always harassed, often kept poor, and
 sometimes ruined, by systematic piracy and the invasion of their
 rights. The government, on the other hand, could not help seeing that,
 as the books could not possibly be kept out of the realm, it was to be
 regretted that their production conferred no benefit on the
 manufacturing industry of the realm, the composition, the printing,
 the casting of type, the fabrication of paper, the preparation of
 leather and vellum, the making of machines and tools. When Bayle's
 Dictionary appeared, it was the rage of Europe. Hundreds of the
 ever-renowned folios found their way into France, and were paid for by
 French money. The booksellers addressed the minister, and easily
 persuaded him of the difference, according to the economic light of
 those days, between an exchange of money against paper, compared with
 an exchange of paper against paper. The minister replied that this was
 true, but still that the gates of the kingdom would never be opened to
 a single copy of Bayle. "The best thing to do," he said, "is to print
 it here." And the third edition of Bayle was printed in France, much
 to the contentment of the French printers, binders, and
 booksellers.</p>

 <p>In 1761 the booksellers were afflicted by a new alarm. Foreign
 pirates and domestic hawkers were doing them mischief enough. But in
 that year the government struck a blow at the very principle of
 literary property. The King's Council conferred upon the descendants
 of La Fontaine the exclusive privilege of publishing their ancestor's
 works. That is to say, the Council took away without compensation from
 La Fontaine's publishers a copyright for which they had paid in hard
 cash. The whole corporation naturally rose in arms, and in due time
 the lieutenant of police was obliged to take the whole matter into
 serious consideration—whether the maintenance of the guild of
 publishers was expedient; whether the royal privilege of publishing a
 book should be regarded as conferring a definite and unassailable
 right of property in the publication; whether the tacit permission to
 publish what it would have been thought unbecoming to authorise
 expressly by royal sanction, should not be granted liberally or even
 universally; and whether the old restriction of the booksellers to one
 quarter of the town ought to remain in force any longer. M. de Sartine
 invited Diderot to write him a memorandum on the subject, and was
 disappointed to find Diderot staunchly on the side of the booksellers
 (1767). He makes no secret, indeed, that for his own part he would
 like to see the whole apparatus of restraint abolished, but meanwhile
 he is strong for doing all that a system of regulation, as opposed to
 a system of freedom, can do to make the publication of books a source
 of prosperity to the bookseller, and of cheap acquisition to the
 book-buyer. Above all things, Diderot is vehemently in favour of the
 recognition of literary property, and against such infringement of it
 as had been ventured upon in the case of La Fontaine. He had no reason
 to be especially friendly to booksellers, but for one thing, he saw
 that to nullify or to tamper with copyright was in effect to prevent
 an author from having any commodity to sell, and so to do him the most
 serious injury possible. And for another thing, Diderot had equity and
 common sense enough to see that no high-flown nonsense about the
 dignity of letters and the spiritual power could touch the fact that a
 book is a piece of marketable ware, and that the men who deal in such
 wares have as much claim to be protected in their contracts as those
 who deal in any other wares.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id=
 "FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class=
 "fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

 <p>There is a vivid illustration of this unexpected business-like
 quality in Diderot, in a conversation that he once had with
 D'Alembert. The dialogue is interesting to those who happen to be
 curious as to the characters of two famous men. It was in 1759, when
 D'Alembert was tired of the Encyclopædia, and was for making hard
 terms as the condition of his return to it. "If," said Diderot to him,
 "six months ago, when we met to deliberate on the continuation of the
 work, you had then proposed these terms, the booksellers would have
 closed with them on the spot, but now, when they have the strongest
 reasons to be out of humour with you, that is another thing."</p>

 <p>"And pray, what reasons?"</p>

 <p>"Can you ask me?"</p>

 <p>"Certainly."</p>

 <p>"Then I will tell you. You have a bargain with the booksellers; the
 terms are stipulated; you have nothing to ask beyond them. If you
 worked harder than you were bound to do, that was out of your interest
 in the book, out of friendship to me, out of respect for yourself;
 people do not pay in money for such motives as these. Still they sent
 you twenty louis a volume: that makes a hundred and forty louis that
 you had beyond what was due to you. You plan a journey to Wesel [in
 1752, to meet Frederick of Prussia] at a time when you were wanted by
 them here; they do not detain you; on the contrary, you are short of
 money, and they supply you. You accept a couple of hundred louis; this
 debt you forget for two or three years. At the end of that rather long
 term you bethink you of paying. What do they do? They hand you back
 your note of hand torn up, with all the air of being very glad to have
 served you. Then, after all, you turn your back on an undertaking in
 which they have embarked their whole fortunes: an affair of a couple
 of millions is a trifle unworthy of the attention of a philosopher
 like you.... But that is not all. You have a fancy for collecting
 together different pieces scattered through the Encyclopædia; nothing
 can be more opposed to their interests; they put this to you, you
 insist, the edition is produced, they advance the cost, you share the
 profits. It seemed that, after having thus twice paid you for their
 work, they had a right to look upon it as theirs. Yet you go in search
 of a bookseller in some quite different direction, and sell him in a
 mass what does not belong to you."</p>

 <p>"They gave me a thousand grounds for dissatisfaction."</p>

 <p>"<i>Quelle défaite!</i> There are no small things between friends.
 Everything weighs, because friendship is a commerce of purity and
 delicacy; but are the booksellers your friends? Then your behaviour to
 them is horrible. If not, then you have nothing to say against them.
 If the public were called upon to judge between you and them, my
 friend, you would be covered with shame."</p>

 <p>"What, can it be you, Diderot, who thus take the side of the
 booksellers?"</p>

 <p>"My grievances against them do not prevent me from seeing their
 grievances against you. After all this show of pride, confess now that
 you are cutting a very sorry figure?"<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id=
 "FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class=
 "fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

 <p>All this was the language of good sense, and there is no evidence
 that Diderot ever swerved from that fair and honourable attitude in
 his own dealings with the booksellers. Yet he was able to treat them
 with a sturdy spirit when they forgot themselves. Panckoucke, one of
 the great publishers of the time, came to him one day. "He was swollen
 with the arrogance of a parvenu, and thinking apparently that he could
 use me like one of those poor devils who depend upon him for a crust
 of bread, he permitted himself to fly into a passion; but it did not
 succeed at all. I let him go on as he pleased; then I got up abruptly,
 I took him by the arm, and I said to him: 'M. Panckoucke, in whatever
 place it may be, in the street, in church, in a bad house, and to
 whomsoever it may be, it is always right to keep a civil tongue in
 one's head. But that is all the more necessary still, when you speak
 to a man who has as little patience as I have, and that, too, in his
 own house. Go to the devil, you and your work. If you would give me
 twenty thousand louis, and I could do your business for you in the
 twinkling of an eye, I would not stir a finger. Be kind enough to be
 off."<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

 <p>Before returning from the author to his books, it is interesting to
 know how he and his circle appeared at this period to some who did not
 belong to them. Gibbon, for instance, visited Paris in the spring of
 1763. "The moment," he says, "was happily chosen. At the close of a
 successful war the British name was respected on the continent;
 <i>clarum et venerabile nomen gentibus</i>. Our opinions, our
 fashions, even our games were adopted in France, a ray of national
 glory illuminated each individual, and every Englishman was supposed
 to be born a patriot and philosopher." He mentions D'Alembert and
 Diderot as those among the men of letters whom he saw, who "held the
 foremost rank in merit, or at least in fame."<a name=
 "FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

 <p>Horace Walpole was often in Paris, and often saw the philosophic
 circle, but it did not please his supercilious humour.</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>"There was no soul in Paris but philosophers, whom I wished in
  heaven, though they do not wish themselves so. They are so
  overbearing and underbred.... I sometimes go to Baron d'Holbach's,
  but I have left off his dinners, as there was no bearing the authors
  and philosophers and savants of which he has a pigeon-house full.
  They soon turned my head with a system of antediluvian deluges which
  they have invented to prove the eternity of matter.... In short,
  nonsense for nonsense, I liked the Jesuits better than the
  philosophers."<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id=
  "FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class=
  "fnanchor">[246]</a></p>
 </div>

 <p>Hume, as everybody knows, found "the men of letters really very
 agreeable; all of them men of the world, living in entire, or almost
 entire harmony, among themselves, and quite irreproachable in their
 morals." He places Diderot among those whose person and conversation
 he liked best.</p>

 <p>We have always heard much of the power of the Salon in the
 eighteenth century, and it was no doubt a remarkable proof of the
 incorporation of intellectual interests in manners, that so many
 groups of men and women should have met habitually every week for the
 purpose of conversing about the new books and new plays, the fresh
 principles and fresh ideas, that were produced by the incessant
 vivacity of the time. The Salon of the eighteenth century passed
 through various phases; its character shifted with the intellectual
 mood of the day, but in all its phases it was an institution in which
 women occupied a place that they have never acquired in any society
 out of France. We are not here called upon to speculate as to the
 reasons for this; it is only worth remarking that Diderot was not
 commonly at his ease in the society of ladies, and that though he was
 a visitor at Madame Geoffrin's and at Mademoiselle Lespinasse's, yet
 he was not a constant attendant at any of the famous circles of which
 women had made themselves the centre. The reader of Madame d'Epinay's
 memoir is informed how hard she found it to tame Diderot into
 sociability. "What a pity," she exclaims, "that men of genius and of
 such eminent merit as M. Diderot should thus wrap themselves up in
 their philosophy, and disdain the homage that people would eagerly pay
 them in any society that they would honour with their
 presence."<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id=
 "FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class=
 "fnanchor">[247]</a> One of the soundest social observers of the time
 was undoubtedly Duclos. His <i>Considerations on the Manners of the
 Century</i>, which was published in 1751, abounds in admirable
 criticism. He makes two remarks with which we may close our chapter.
 "The relaxation of morals does not prevent people from being very loud
 in praise of honour and virtue; those who have least of them know very
 well how much they are concerned in other people having them." Again,
 "The French," he said, "are the only people among whom it is possible
 for morals to be depraved, without either the heart being corrupted,
 or their courage being weakened."</p>

 THE STAGE.</h2>

 <p>There is at first something incredible in the account given by some
 thinkers of Diderot, as the greatest genius of the eighteenth century;
 and perhaps an adjustment of such nice degrees of comparison among the
 high men of the world is at no time very profitable. What is intended
 by these thoroughgoing panegyrists is that Diderot placed himself at
 the point of view whence, more comprehensively than was possible from
 any other, he discerned the long course and the many bearings, the
 complex faces and the large ramifications, of the huge movement of his
 day. He seized the great transition at every point, and grasped all
 the threads that were to be inwoven into the pattern of the new
 time.</p>

 <p>Diderot is in a thousand respects one of the most unsatisfactory of
 men and of writers. Yet it is hard to deny that to whatever quarter he
 turned, he caught the rising illumination and was shone upon by the
 spirit of the coming day. It was no copious and overflowing radiance,
 but they were the beams of the dawn. Hence, what he has to say, and we
 shall soon see how much he said, about the two great arts of painting
 and the drama, though it is fragmentary, though it is insufficient,
 yet points, as all the rest of his thoughts pointed, along the lines
 that the best minds of the western world have since traversed. He
 would, in the old metaphysical language, have called the direction of
 it a turning to Nature, but if we translate this into more positive
 terms, just as we have said that the Encyclopædia was a glorification
 of pacific industry and of civil justice, so we may say that his whole
 theory of the drama was a glorification of private virtues and
 domestic life. And the definite rise of civil justice and industry
 over feudal privilege and a life of war, and again the elevation of
 domestic virtue into the place formerly held by patriotic devotion,
 are the two great sides of a single movement.<a name=
 "FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> It is quite true that
 Diderot and the French of that day had only a glimpse of the promised
 land in art and poetry. The whole moral energy of the generation after
 Diderot was drawn inevitably into the strong current of social action.
 The freshly kindled torch of dramatic art passed for nearly half a
 century to the country of Lessing and Goethe.</p>

 <p>There is in the use of a certain kind of abstract language this
 inconvenience, that the reader may suppose us to be imputing to
 Diderot a deliberate and systematic survey of the whole movement of
 his time, and a calculated resolution to further it, now in this way
 and now in that. It is not necessary to suppose that the movement as a
 whole was always present to him. Diderot's mind was constantly feeling
 for explanations; it was never a passive recipient. The drama excited
 this alert interest just as everything else excited it. He thought
 about that, as about everything else, originally, that is to say,
 sincerely and in the spirit of reality.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id=
 "FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class=
 "fnanchor">[249]</a> Whoever turns with a clear eye and proper
 intellectual capacity in search of the real bearings of what he is
 about, is sure to find out the strong currents of the time, even
 though he may never consciously throw them into their most general and
 abstract expression.</p>

 <p>Since Aristotle, said Lessing, no more philosophical mind than
 Diderot's has treated of the theatre. Lessing himself translated
 Diderot's two plays, and the Essay on Dramatic Poetry, and repeatedly
 said that without the impulse of Diderot's principles and
 illustrations his own taste would have taken a different direction. As
 a dramatist, the author of <i>Miss Sara Sampson</i>, of <i>Emilia
 Galotti</i>, and above all that noble dramatic poem, <i>Nathan the
 Wise</i>, could hardly have owed much to the author of such poor stuff
 as <i>The Natural Son</i> and <i>The Father of the Family</i>. Lessing
 had some dramatic fire, invention, spontaneous elevation; he had a
 certain measure, though not a very large one, of poetic impulse.
 Diderot had nothing of all these, but he had the eye of the
 philosophic critic.</p>

 <p>Any one who reads Lessing's dramatic criticisms will see that he
 did not at all overrate his obligations to his French
 contemporary.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id=
 "FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class=
 "fnanchor">[250]</a> It has been replied to the absurd taunt about the
 French inventing nothing, that at least Descartes invented German
 philosophy. Still more true is it that Diderot invented German
 criticism.</p>

 <p>Diderot's thoughts on the stage, besides his completed plays, and a
 number of fragmentary scenes, are contained principally in the Paradox
 on the Player, a short treatise on Dramatic Poetry, and three
 dialogues appended to <i>The Natural Son</i>. On the plays a very few
 words will suffice. <i>The Natural Son</i> must, by me at least, be
 pronounced one of the most vapid performances in dramatic history.
 Even Lessing, unwilling as he was to say a word against a writer who
 had taught him so much, is too good a critic not to recognise monotony
 in the characters, stiffness and affectation in the dialogue, and a
 pedantic ring in the sentences of new-fangled philosophy.<a name=
 "FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Even in the three
 critical dialogues that Diderot added to the play, Lessing cannot help
 discerning the mixture of superficiality with an almost pompous
 pretension. Rosenkranz, it is true, finds the play rich in fine
 sentences, in scenes full of effect, in which Diderot's moral
 enthusiasm expresses itself with impetuous eloquence. But even he
 admits that the hero's servant is not so far wrong when he cries,
 "<i>Il semble que le bon sens se soit enfui de cette maison</i>," and
 adds that the whole atmosphere of the piece is sickly with conscious
 virtue.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> For ourselves we are
 ready for once even to sympathise with Palissot, the hack-writer of
 the reactionary parties, when he says that <i>The Natural Son</i> had
 neither invention, nor style, nor characters, nor any other single
 unit of a truly dramatic work. The reader who seeks to realise the
 nullity of the <i>genre sérieux</i> in Diderot's hands, should turn
 from <i>The Natural Son</i> to Goldoni's play of <i>The True
 Friend</i>, from which Diderot borrowed the structure of his play,
 following it as narrowly as possible to the end of the third act.
 Seldom has transfusion turned a sparkling draught into anything so
 flat and vapid. In spite of the applause of the philosophic
 <i>claque</i>, led by Grimm,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id=
 "FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class=
 "fnanchor">[253]</a> posterity has ratified the coldness with which it
 was received by contemporaries. <i>The Natural Son</i> was written in
 1757, but it was not until 1771 that the directors of the French
 Comedy could be induced to place it on the stage. The actors detested
 their task, and as we can very well believe, went sulkily through
 parts which they had not even taken the trouble to master.<a name=
 "FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> The public felt as
 little interest in the piece as the actors had done, and after a
 single representation, the play was put aside.</p>

 <p>Ill-natured critics compared Diderot's play with Rousseau's opera;
 they insisted that <i>The Natural Son</i> and <i>The Village
 Conjuror</i> were a couple of monuments of the presumptuous
 incompetence of the encyclopædic cabal. The failure of <i>The Natural
 Son</i> as a drama came after it had enjoyed considerable success as a
 piece of literature, for it had been fourteen years in print. We can
 only suppose that this success was the fruit of an unflinching
 partisanship.</p>

 <p>It is a curious illustration of the strength of the current passion
 for moral maxims in season and out of season, that one scene which to
 the scoffers of that day seemed, as it cannot but seem to everybody
 to-day, a climax of absurdity and unbecomingness, was hailed by the
 party as most admirable, for no other reason than that it contained a
 number of high moralising saws. Constance, a young widow and a model
 of reason, takes upon herself to combat the resolution of Dorval not
 to marry, after he has led her to suppose that he has a passion for
 her, and after a marriage between them has been arranged. "No," he
 cries, "a man of my character is not such a husband as befits
 Constance." Constance begs him to reassure himself; tells him that he
 is mistaken; to enjoy tranquillity, a man must have the approval of
 his own heart, and perhaps that of other men, and he can have neither
 unless he remains at his post; it is only the wicked who can bear
 isolation; a tender soul cannot view the general system of sensible
 beings without a strong desire that they should be happy. Dorval, who
 cuts an extremely sorry figure in such a scene, exclaims, "Ah, but
 children! Dorval would have children! When I think that we are thrown
 from our very birth into a chaos of prejudices, extravagances, vices,
 and miseries, the idea makes me shudder!"—"Dorval, you are beset by
 phantoms, and no wonder. The history of life is so little known, while
 the appearance of evil in the universe is so glaring.... Dorval, your
 daughters will be modest and good; your sons noble and high-minded;
 all your children will be charming.... There is no fear that a cruel
 soul should ever grow in my bosom from stock of yours."<a name=
 "FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

 <p>We can hardly wonder that players were disgusted, or critics moved
 to wicked jests. The counterpart to the scene in which Constance
 persuades Dorval that they would be very happy in one case, is the
 scene in which Dorval persuades Rosalie that they would be very
 unhappy in another case. The situations in themselves may command our
 approval morally, but they certainly do not attract our sympathies
 dramatically. That a woman should demonstrate to a man in fine
 sententious language the expediency of marrying her, is not
 inconsistent with good sense, but it is displeasing. When a man tells
 a woman that, though love draws in one way, duty draws in the other,
 we may admire his prudence, but we are glad when so delicate a
 business comes to an end. In <i>The Natural Son</i> the latter scene,
 though very long, is the less disagreeable of the two. And just as in
 Diderot's most wordy and tiresome pages we generally find some one
 phrase, some epithet, some turn of a sentence whose freshness or
 strength or daring reveals a genius, so in this scene we find a few
 lines whose energy reminds us that we are not after all in the hands
 of some obscure playwright, whose works ought long ago to have been
 eaten by moths or burnt by fire. Those lines are a warning against the
 temptation so familiar in every age since Paris was a guest in the
 halls of Menelaus, to take that fatal resolve, All for love and the
 world well lost. "To do wrong," says Dorval, "is to condemn ourselves
 to live and to find our pleasure with wrong-doers; it is to pass an
 uncertain and troubled life in one long and never-ending lie; to have
 to praise with a blush the virtue that we flung behind us; to hear
 from the lips of others harsh words for our own action; to seek a
 little calm in sophistical systems, that the breath of a single good
 man scatters to the winds; to shut ourselves for ever out from the
 spring of true joys, the only joys that are virtuous, austere,
 sublime; and to give ourselves up, simply as a way of escape from
 ourselves, to the weariness of those frivolous diversions in which the
 day flows away in self-oblivion, and our life glides slowly from us
 and loses itself in waste."<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id=
 "FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class=
 "fnanchor">[256]</a> A very old story, no doubt; but natural, true,
 and in its place.</p>

 <p>What adds to the flatness of the play is a device which Diderot
 introduced on a deliberately adopted principle; we mean the elaborate
 setting out of the acting directions. Every movement, every gesture,
 every silent pause is written down, and we have the impression less of
 a play than of some strangely bald romance. In the versified
 declamation which then reigned on the French stage, nothing was left
 to natural action, nothing was told by change of position, by movement
 without speech, or in short by any means other than discourse.
 Diderot, repudiating the conventions of dramatic art, and consulting
 nature or reality, saw that there are many scenes in life in which it
 is more natural to the personages of the scene to move than to speak,
 in which indeed motion is natural, and speech is altogether unnatural.
 If this be so in real life, he said, it should be so on the stage,
 because nothing passes in the world which may not pass also in the
 theatre; and as pantomime, or expression of emotion, feeling, purpose,
 otherwise than by speech, has so much to do in life, the dramatist
 should make abundant use of pantomime in composing stage-plays. Nor
 should he trust to the actor's invention and spontaneous sense of
 appropriateness. He ought to write down the pantomime whenever it adds
 energy or clearness to the dialogue; when it binds the parts of the
 dialogue together; when it consists in a delicate play that is not
 easily divined; and almost always he ought to write it down in the
 opening of a scene. If any one is inclined to regard this as
 superfluous, let him try the experiment of composing a play, and then
 writing the pantomime, or "business," for it; he will soon see what
 follies he commits.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id=
 "FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class=
 "fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

 <p>Whatever we may think of the practice of writing the action as well
 as the words for the player, nobody would now dispute the wisdom of
 what Diderot says as to the part that pantomime fills in the highest
 kind of dramatic representation. We must agree with his repeated
 laments over the indigence, for purposes of full and adequate
 expression, of every language that ever has existed or ever can
 exist.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> "My dear master," he
 wrote to Voltaire on the occasion of a performance of <i>Tancred</i>,
 "if you could have seen Clairon passing across the stage, her knees
 bending under her, her eyes closed, her arms falling stiff by her side
 as if they were dead; if you heard the cry that she uttered when she
 perceives Tancred, you would remain more convinced than ever that
 silence and pantomime have sometimes a pathos that all the resources
 of speech can never approach."<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id=
 "FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class=
 "fnanchor">[259]</a> If we wonder that he should have thought it worth
 while to lay so much emphasis on what seems so obvious, we have to
 remember that it did not seem at all obvious to people who were
 accustomed to the substitution of a mannered and symmetrical
 declamation for the energetic variety and manifold exuberance of
 passion and judgment in the daily lives of men.</p>

 <p>We have already seen that even when he wrote the Letter on the Deaf
 and Dumb, Diderot's mind was exercised about gesture as a supplement
 to discourse. In that Letter he had told a curious story of a bizarre
 experiment that he was in the habit of making at the theatre. He used
 to go to the highest seats in the house, thrust his fingers into his
 ears, and then, to the astonishment of his neighbours, watch the
 performance with the sharpest interest. As a constant playgoer, he
 knew the words of the plays by heart, and what he sought was to
 isolate the gesture of the performers, and to enjoy and criticise that
 by itself. He kept his ears tightly stopped, so long as the action and
 play went well with the words as he remembered them, and he only
 listened when some discord in gesture made him suppose that he had
 lost his place. The people around him were more and more amazed as
 they saw him, notwithstanding his stopped ears, shed copious tears in
 the pathetic passages. "They could not refrain from hazarding
 questions, to which I answered coldly, 'that everybody had his own way
 of listening, and that my way was to stop my ears, so as to understand
 better'—laughing within myself at the talk to which my oddity gave
 rise, and still more so at the simplicity of some young people who
 also put their fingers into their ears to hear after my fashion, and
 were quite astonished that the plan did not succeed."<a name=
 "FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> This was an odd and
 whimsical way of acting on a conviction which lay deep in Diderot's
 mind, namely, that language is a very poor, misleading, and utterly
 inadequate instrument for representing what it professes, and what we
 stupidly suppose it, to represent. Rousseau had expressed the same
 kind of feeling when he said that definitions might be good things, if
 only we did not employ words in making them.</p>

 <p>A curious circumstance is worth mentioning in connection with the
 Three Dialogues appended to <i>The Natural Son</i>. Diderot informs
 his readers that the incidents of <i>The Natural Son</i> had actually
 occurred in real life, and that he knew the personages. In the
 Dialogues it is assumed that the play had been written by the hero
 himself, and the hero is the chief speaker. Not a word is said from
 which the reader would guess that Diderot had borrowed the substance
 of his plot and some of its least insipid scenes from Goldoni. We can
 hardly wonder that he was charged with plagiarism. Yet it was not
 deliberate, we may be sure. When Diderot was strongly seized by an
 idea, outer circumstances were as if they did not exist. He was swept
 up into the clouds. "Diderot is a good and worthy man," wrote Madame
 Geoffrin to the King of Poland, "but he has such a bad head, and he is
 so curiously organised, that he neither sees nor hears what he does
 see and hear, as the thing really is; he is always like a man who is
 dreaming, and who thinks all that he has dreamed quite real."<a name=
 "FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

 <p><i>The Father of the Family</i>, written in 1758, and first acted
 in 1761, is very superior to <i>The Natural Son</i>; it even enjoyed a
 certain popularity. In Germany it became an established favourite, and
 in Italy it was only less popular than a piece of Goldoni's. The
 French were not quite so easy to please. In 1761 its reception was
 undoubtedly favourable, and it ran for more than a week. In 1769 it
 was reproduced, and, according to Diderot's own account, with
 enthusiasm. "There was a frightful crowd," he says, "and people hardly
 remember such a success. I was surprised at it myself. My friends are
 at the height of exultation. My daughter came home intoxicated with
 wonder and delight." Even Madame Diderot at length grew ashamed at
 having to confess that she had not seen her husband's triumph, and
 throwing aside her horror of the stage, was as deeply moved as every
 one else.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

 <p>Notwithstanding this satisfactory degree of success, and though it
 was performed as late as 1835, the play never struck root in France.
 It is indeed a play without any real quality or distinction. "Diderot,
 in his plays," said Madame de Staël, "put the affectation of nature in
 the place of the affectation of convention."<a name="FNanchor_263_263"
 id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class=
 "fnanchor">[263]</a> The effect is still more disagreeable in the
 first kind of affectation than the second. <i>The Father of the
 Family</i> is made more endurable than <i>The Natural Son</i> by a
 certain rapidity and fire in the action, and a certain vigour in the
 characters of the impetuous son (Saint Albin) and the malignant
 brother-in-law (the Commander). But the dialogue is poor, and the
 Father of the Family himself is as woolly and mawkish a figure as is
 usually made out of benevolent intentions and weak purpose combined.
 The woes of the heavy father of the stage, where there is no true
 pathos, but only a sentimental version of it, find us very callous.
 The language has none of that exquisite grace and flexibility which
 makes a good French comedy of own day, a piece by Augier, Sandeau,
 Feuillet, Sardou, so delightful. Diderot was right in urging that
 there is no reason why a play should be in verse; but then the prose
 of a play ought to have a point, elegance, and highly-wrought
 perfection, which shall fill us with a sense of art, though not the
 art of the poet. Diderot not only did not write comedy in such a
 style; but he does not even so much as show consciousness that any
 difference exists between one kind of prose and another. The blurred
 phrases and clipped sentences of what Diderot would have called
 Nature, that is to say of real life, are intolerable on the stage.
 Even he felt this, for his characters, though their dialogue is
 without wit or finish, are still dull and tame of speech, in a
 different way from that in which the people whom we may meet are dull
 and tame. There is an art of a kind, though of an extremely vapid
 kind.</p>

 <p>Again, though he may be right in contending that there is a serious
 kind of comedy as distinct from that gay comedy which is neighbour to
 farce—of this we shall see more presently—yet he is certainly wrong in
 believing that we can willingly endure five acts of serious comedy
 without a single relieving passage of humour. Contrast of character,
 where all the characters are realistic and common, is not enough. We
 crave contrast in the dramatic point of view. We seek occasional
 change of key. That serious comedy should move a sympathetic tear is
 reasonable enough; but it is hard to find that it grudges us a single
 smile. The result of Diderot's method is that the spectator or the
 reader speedily feels that what he has before him substitutes for
 dramatic fulness and variety the flat monotony of a homily or a tract.
 It would be hard to show that there is no true comedy without
 laughter—Terence's <i>Hecyra</i>, for instance—but Diderot certainly
 overlooked what Lessing and most other critics saw so clearly, that
 laughter rightly stirred is one of the most powerful agencies in
 directing the moral sympathies of the audience,—the very end that
 Diderot most anxiously sought.</p>

 <p>It is mere waste of time to bestow serious criticism on Diderot's
 two plays, or on the various sketches, outlines, and fragments of
 scenes with which he amused his very slight dramatic faculty. If we
 wish to study the masterpieces of French comedy in the eighteenth
 century, we shall promptly shut up the volumes of Diderot, and turn to
 the ease and soft gracefulness of Marivaux's <i>Game of Love and
 Chance</i>, to the forcible and concentrated sententiousness of
 Piron's <i>Métromanie</i>, to the salt and racy flavour of Le Sage's
 <i>Turcaret</i>. Gresset, again, and Destouches wrote at least two
 comedies that were really fit for the stage, and may be read with
 pleasure to-day. Neither of these compliments can fairly be paid to
 <i>The Natural Son</i> and <i>The Father of the Family</i>. Diderot's
 plays ought to be looked upon merely as sketchy illustrations of a
 favourite theory; as the rough drawings on the black board with which
 a professor of the fine arts may accompany a lecture on oil
 painting.</p>

 <p>One radical part of Diderot's dramatic doctrine is wholly condemned
 by modern criticism; and it is the part which his plays were
 especially designed to enforce. "It is always," he says, "virtue and
 virtuous people that a man ought to have in view when he writes. Oh,
 what good would men gain, if all the arts of imitation proposed one
 common object, and were one day to unite with the laws in making us
 love virtue and hate vice. It is for the philosopher to address
 himself to the poet, the painter, the musician, and to cry to them
 with all his might: <i>0 men of genius, to what end has heaven endowed
 you with gifts</i>? If they listen to him, speedily will the images of
 debauch cease to cover the walls of our palaces; our vices will cease
 to be the organs of crime; and taste and manners will gain. Can we
 believe that the action of two old blind people, man and wife, as they
 sought one another in their aged days, and with tears of tenderness
 clasped one another's hands and exchanged caresses on the brink of the
 grave, so to say—that this would not demand the same talent, and would
 not interest me far more than the spectacle of the violent pleasures
 with which their senses in all the first freshness of youth were once
 made drunk?"<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id=
 "FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class=
 "fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

 <p>The emphasising moralists of Diderot's school never understood that
 virtue may be made attractive, without pulling the reader or the
 spectator by the sleeve, and urgently shouting in his ear how
 attractive virtue is. When <i>The Heart of Midlothian</i> appeared
 (1818), a lady wrote about it as follows: "Of late days, especially
 since it has been the fashion to write moral and even religious
 novels, one might almost say of the wise good heroines what a lively
 girl once said of her well-meaning aunt—'On my word she is enough to
 make anybody wicked.' Had this very story been conducted by a common
 hand, Effie would have attracted all our concern and sympathy, Jeanie
 only cold approbation. Whereas Jeanie, without youth, beauty, genius,
 warm passions, or any other novel perfection, is here our object from
 beginning to end. This is 'enlisting the affections in the cause of
 virtue' ten times more than ever Richardson did; for whose male and
 female pedants, all excelling as they are, I never could care half as
 much as I found myself inclined to do for Jeanie before I finished the
 first volume."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id=
 "FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class=
 "fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

 <p>In other words, you must win us by kindling our sympathy, not by
 formally commanding our moral approval. To kindle sympathy your
 personage must be interesting; must touch our pity or wonder or
 energetic fellow-feeling or sense of moral loveliness, which is a very
 different thing from touching our mere sense of the distinctions
 between right and wrong. Direct homily excites no sympathy with the
 homilist. Deep pensive meditations on the moral puzzles of the world
 are not at all like didactic discourse. But the Father of the Family
 was exactly fulfilling Diderot's notion of dramatic purpose and
 utility when he talked to his daughter in such a strain as this:
 "Marriage, my daughter, is a vocation imposed by nature.... He who
 counts on bliss without alloy knows neither the life of man nor the
 designs of heaven. If marriage exposes us to cruel pain, it is also
 the source of the sweetest pleasures. Where are the examples of pure
 and heartfelt interest, of real tenderness, of inmost confidence, of
 daily help of griefs divided, of tears mingled, if they be not in
 marriage? What is there in the world that the good man prefers to his
 wife? What is there in the world that a father loves more dearly than
 his children? O sacred bond, if I think of thee, my whole soul is
 warmed and elevated!"<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id=
 "FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class=
 "fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

 <p>But these virtuous ejaculations do not warm and elevate us. In such
 a case words count for nothing. It is actual presentation of beautiful
 character, and not talk about it, that touches the spectator. It is
 the association of interesting action with character, that moves us
 and inspires such better moods as may be within our compass. Diderot,
 like many other people before and since, sought to make the stage the
 great moral teacher. That it may become so, is possible. It will not
 be by imitating the methods of that colossal type of histrionic
 failure, the church-pulpit. Exhortation in set speeches always has
 been, and always will be, the feeblest bulwark against the boiling
 floods of passion that helpless virtue ever invented, and it matters
 not at all whether the hortatory speeches are placed on the lips of
 Mr. Talkative, the son of Saywell, or of some tearful dummy labelled
 the Father of the Family.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id=
 "FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class=
 "fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

 <p>Yet one is half ashamed to use hard words about Diderot. He was so
 modest about his work, so simple and unpretending, so wholly without
 restless and fretting ambitions, and so generous in his judgment of
 others. He made his own dramatic experiment, he thought little enough
 of it; and he was wholly above the hateful vice of sourly disparaging
 competitors, whether dead or living. He knew that he was himself no
 master, but he was manly enough to admire anybody who was nearer to
 mastery. He was full of unaffected delight at Sedaine's busy and
 pleasing little comedy, <i>The Philosopher without knowing it</i>; it
 was so simple without being stiff, so eloquent without the shadow of
 effort or rhetoric. After seeing it, Diderot ran off to the author to
 embrace him, with many tears of joyful sympathy and gratitude.
 Sedaine, like Lillo, the author of Diderot's favourite play of
 <i>George Barn</i><i>well</i>, was a plain tradesman, and the success
 of his libretti for comic operas had not spoiled him. He could find no
 more expansive words for his excited admirer than "<i>Ah, Monsieur
 Diderot, que vous étes beau</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id=
 "FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class=
 "fnanchor">[268]</a> Diderot was just as sensible of the originality
 and Aristophanic gaiety of Collé's brilliant play, <i>Truth in
 Wine</i>, though Collé detested the philosophic school from Voltaire
 downwards, and left behind him a bitterly contemptuous account of
 <i>The Natural Son</i>.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

 <p>Of all comic writers, however, the author of the <i>Andria</i> and
 the <i>Heautontimorumenos</i> was Diderot's favourite. The half dozen
 pages upon Terence, which he threw off while the printer's boy waited
 in the passage (1762), are one of the most easy, flowing, and
 delightful of his fragments; there is such appreciation of Terence's
 suavity and tact, of his just and fine judgment, of his discrimination
 and character. He admits that Terence had no verve; for that he
 commends the young poet to Molière or Aristophanes, but as verve was
 exactly the quality most wanting to Diderot himself, he easily forgave
 its absence in Terence, and thought it amply replaced by his
 moderation, his truth, and his fine taste. Colman is praised for
 translating Terence, for here, says Diderot, is the lesson of which
 Colman's countrymen stand most in need. The English comic writers have
 more verve than taste. "Vanbrugh, Wycherley, Congreve, and some others
 have painted vices and foibles with vigour; it is not either invention
 or warmth or gaiety or force that is wanting to their pencil, but
 rather that unity in the drawing, that precision in the stroke, that
 truth in colouring, which distinguish portrait from caricature.
 Especially are they wanting in the art of discerning and seizing those
 <i>naïf</i>, simple, and yet singular movements of character, which
 always please and astonish, and render the imitation at once true and
 piquant."<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Criticism has really
 nothing to add to these few lines, and if Diderot in his last years
 read <i>The School for Scandal</i>, or <i>The Rivals</i>, he would
 have found no reason to alter his judgment.</p>

 <p>One English play had the honour of being translated by Diderot;
 this was <i>The Gamester</i>, not <i>The Gamester</i> of Shirley nor
 of Garrick, but of Edward Moore (1753). It is a good example of the
 bourgeois tragedy or domestic drama, which Diderot was so eager to see
 introduced on to the French stage. The infatuation of Beverley, the
 tears and virtue of Mrs. Beverley, the prudence of Charlotte and the
 sage devotion of her lover, the sympathetic remorse of Bates, and even
 the desperation of Stukely, made up a picture of domestic misery and
 moral sentiment with which Diderot was sure to fall in love.
 Lillo's</p>

 <p><i>George Barnwell</i>, with its direct and urgent moral, was a
 still greater favourite, and Diderot compared the scene between Maria
 and Barnwell in prison to the despair of the <i>Philocletes</i> of
 Sophocles, as the hero is heard shrieking at the mouth of his
 cavern;<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id=
 "FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class=
 "fnanchor">[271]</a> just as a more modern
 critic has thought Lillo's other play, <i>The Fatal Curiosity</i>,
 worthy of comparison with the <i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i>.</p>

 <p>Diderot's feeling for Shakespeare seems to have been what we might
 have anticipated from the whole cast of his temperament. One of the
 scenes which delighted him most was that moment of awe, when Lady
 Macbeth silently advances down the stage with her eyes closed, and
 imitates the action of washing her hands, as wondering that "the old
 man should have so much blood in him." "I know nothing," he exclaims,
 "so pathetic in discourse as that woman's silence and the movement of
 her hands. What an image of remorse!"<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

 <p>It was not to be expected that Diderot should indulge in those
 undiscriminating superlatives about Shakespeare which are common in
 Shakespeare's country. But he knew enough about him to feel that he
 was dealing with a giant. "I will not compare Shakespeare," he said,
 "to the Belvedere Apollo, nor to the Gladiator, nor to Antinous"—he
 had compared Terence to the Medicean Venus—"but to the Saint
 Christopher of Notre Dame, an unshapely colossus, rudely carven, but
 between whose legs we could all pass without our brows touching
 him."<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Not very satisfactory
 recognition perhaps; but the Saint Christopher is better than
 Voltaire's drunken savage.</p>

 <p>It is not every dramatist who treats the art of acting as seriously
 as the art of composition. The great author of <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>
 is the most remarkable exception to this rule, and Lessing is only
 second to him. It is hardly possible for a man to be a great
 dramatist, and it is simply impossible for a man to be a great critic
 of the drama, who has not seriously studied the rules, aims, and
 conditions of stage representation. Hazlitt, for instance, has written
 some admirable pages about the poetry, the imaginative conception, the
 language, of Shakespeare's plays, but we find his limit when he says
 that King Lear is so noble a play that he cannot bear to see it acted.
 As if a play could be fully judged without reference to the conditions
 of the very object with which it was written. A play is to be
 criticised as a play, not merely as a poem. The whole structure of a
 piece depends on the fact that it is to be acted; its striking moments
 must be great dramatic, not merely beautiful poetic, moments. They
 must have the intensity of pitch by which the effect of action exceeds
 the effect of narrative. This intensity is made almost infinitely
 variable with the variations in the actor's mastery of his art.</p>

 <p>Diderot, who threw so penetrating a glance into every subject that
 he touched, even if it were no more than a glance, has left a number
 of excellent remarks on histrionics. The key to them all is his
 everlasting watchword: <i>Watch nature, follow her simple, and
 spontaneous leading</i>. The Paradox on the Player is one of the very
 few of Diderot's pieces of which we can say that, besides containing
 vigorous thought, it has real finish in point of literary form. There
 is not the flat tone, the heavy stroke, the loose shamble, that give a
 certain stamp of commonness to so many of his most elaborate
 discussions. In the Paradox the thoughts seem to fall with rapidity
 and precision into their right places; they are direct; they are not
 overloaded with qualifications; their clear delivery is not choked by
 a throng of asides and casual ejaculations. Usually Diderot writes as
 if he were loath to let the sentence go, and to allow the paragraph to
 come to an end. Here he lays down his proposition, and without
 rambling passes on to the next. The effort is not kept up quite to the
 close, for the last half dozen pages have the ordinary clumsy
 mannerism of their author.</p>

 <p>What is the Paradox? That a player of the first rank must have much
 judgment, self-possession, and penetration, <i>but no sensibility</i>.
 An actor with nothing but sense and judgment is apt to be cold; but an
 actor with nothing but verve and sensibility is crazy. It is a certain
 temperament of good sense and warmth combined, that makes the sublime
 player.<a name="FNanchor_274_274"
 id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class=
 "fnanchor">[274]</a> Why should he differ
 from the poet, the painter, the orator, the musician? It is not in the
 fury of the first impulse that characteristic strokes occur to any of
 these men; it is in moments when they are tranquil and cool, and such
 strokes come by an unexpected inspiration.<a name=
 "FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> It is for coolness to temper the delirium of
 enthusiasm. It is not the violent man who is beside himself that
 disposes of us; that is an advantage reserved for the man who
 possesses himself. The great poets, the great actors, and perhaps
 generally all the great imitators of nature, whatever they may be, are
 gifted with a fine imagination, a great judgment, a subtle tact, a
 sure taste, but they are creatures of the smallest sensibility. They
 are equally well fitted for too many things; they are too busy in
 looking, in recognising, and in imitating, to be violently affected
 within themselves. Sensibility is hardly the quality of a great
 genius. He will have justice; but he will practise it without reaping
 all the sweetness of it. It is not his heart, but his head, that does
 it all. Well, then, what I insist upon, says Diderot, is that it is
 extreme sensibility that makes mediocre actors; it is mediocre
 sensibility that makes bad actors; and it is the absolute want of
 sensibility that prepares actors who shall be sublime.<a name="FNanchor_276_276"

 <p>This is worked out with great clearness and decision, and some of
 the illustrations to which he resorts to lighten the dialogue are
 amusing enough. Perhaps the most interesting to us English is his
 account of Garrick, whose acquaintance he made towards the year 1765.
 He says that he saw Garrick pass his head between two folding doors,
 and in the space of a few seconds, his face went successively from mad
 joy to moderate joy, from that to tranquillity, from tranquillity to
 surprise, from surprise to astonishment, from astonishment to gloom,
 from gloom to utter dejection, from dejection to fear, from fear to
 horror, from horror to despair, and then reascend from this lowest
 degree to the point whence he had started.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href=

 <p>Of course his soul felt none of these emotions. "If you asked this
 famous man, who by himself was as well worth a journey to England to
 see, as all the wonders of Rome are worth a journey to Italy, if you
 asked him, I say, for the scene of <i>The Little Baker's Boy</i>, he
 played it; if you asked him the next minute for the scene from
 <i>Hamlet</i>, he played that too for you, equally ready to sob over
 the fall of his pies, and to follow the path of the dagger in the
 air."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id=

 <p>Apart from the central proposition, Diderot makes a number of
 excellent observations which show his critical faculty at its best.
 As, for example, in answering the question, what is the truth of the
 stage? Is it to show things exactly as they are in nature? By no
 means. The true in that sense would only be the common. The really
 true is the conformity of action, speech, countenance, voice,
 movement, gesture, with an ideal model imagined by the poet, and often
 exaggerated by the player. And the marvel is that this model
 influences not only the tone, but the whole carriage and gait. Again,
 what is the aim of multiplied rehearsals? To establish a balance among
 the different talents of the actors. The supreme excellence of one
 actor does not recompense you for the mediocrity of the others, which
 is brought by that very superiority into disagreeable prominence.
 Again, accent is easier to imitate than movement, but movements are
 what strike us most violently. Hence a law to which there is no
 exception, namely, under pain of being cold, to make your denouement
 an action and not a narrative.<a name=

 "#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

 <p>One of the strongest satires on the reigning dramatic style,
 Diderot found in the need that the actor had of the mirror. The fewer
 gestures, he said, the better; frequent gesticulation impairs energy
 and destroys nobleness. It is the countenance, the eyes, it is the
 whole body that ought to move, and not the arms.<a name=
 "FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> There is no maxim more
 forgotten by poets than that which says that great passions are mute.
 It depends on the player to produce a greater effect by silence than
 the poet can produce by all his fine speeches.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id=
 "FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class=
 "fnanchor">[281]</a> Above all, the player
 is to study tranquil scenes, for it is these that are the most truly
 difficult. He commends a young actress to play every morning, by way
 of orisons, the scene of Athalie with Joas; to say for evensong some
 scenes of Agrippina with Nero; and for Benedicite the first scene of
 Phædra with her confidante. Especially there is to be little
 emphasis—a warning grievously needed by ninety-nine English speakers
 out of a hundred—for emphasis is hardly ever natural; it is only a
 forced imitation of nature.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id=

 <p>Diderot had perceived very early that the complacency with which
 his countrymen regarded the national theatre was extravagant. He would
 not allow a comparison between the conventional classic of the French
 stage and the works of the Greek stage. He insisted in the case of the
 Greeks that their subjects are noble, well chosen, and interesting;
 that the action seems to develop itself spontaneously; that their
 dialogue is simple and very close to what is natural; that the
 dénouements are not forced; that the interest is not divided nor the
 action overloaded with episodes. In the French classic he found none
 of these merits. He found none of that truth which is the only secret
 of pleasing and touching us; none of that simple and natural movement
 which is the only path to perfect and unbroken illusion. The dialogue
 is all emphasis, wit, glitter; all a thousand leagues away from
 nature. Instead of artificially giving to their characters
 <i>esprit</i> at every point, poets ought to place them in such
 situations as will give it to them. Where in the world did men and
 women ever speak as we declaim? Why should princes and kings walk
 differently from any man who walks well? Did they then gesticulate
 like raving madmen? Do princesses when they speak utter sharp
 hissings?</p>

 <p>People believe us to have brought tragedy to a high degree of
 perfection. It is not so. Of all kinds of literature it is the most
 imperfect.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id=

 <p>The ideas which appeared thus incongruously in the tales of 1748
 reappeared in the direct essays on the drama in 1757 and 1758. We have
 left nothing undone, he said, to corrupt dramatic style. We have
 preserved from the ancients that emphasis of versification which was
 so well fitted to languages of strong quantity and marked accent, to
 vast theatres, to a declamation that had an instrumental
 accompaniment; and then we have given up simplicity of plot and
 dialogue, and all truth of situation.<a name=
 "FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> La Motte nearly fifty years before had attacked
 the pseudo-classic drama. He had inveighed against the unities,
 against long monologues, against the device of confidants, and against
 verse. His assault, in which he had the powerful aid of Fontenelle,
 was part of that battle between Moderns and Ancients with which the
 literary activity of the century had opened. The brilliant success of
 the tragedies of Voltaire had restored the lustre of the conventional
 drama, though Voltaire infused an element of the romantic under the
 severity of the old forms. But the drama had become even less like
 Sophocles and Euripides in <i>Zaïre</i> than in <i>Phédre</i> or
 <i>Iphigénie</i>. Voltaire intended to constitute the French drama
 into an independent form. He expected to be told that he was not like
 Sophocles, and he did not abstain from some singularly free railing
 against Euripides. The Greek pieces often smacked too much of the tone
 of the fair to satisfy him; they were too familiar and colloquial for
 a taste that had been made fastidious by the court-pieces of Lewis
 XIV. Diderot was kept free from such deplorable criticism as this by
 feeling that the Greek drama was true to the sentiment of the age that
 gave it birth, and that the French drama, if not in the hands of
 Racine, still even in the hands of Voltaire, and much more in the
 hands of such men as Lagrange-Chancel and the elder Crébillon, was
 true to no sentiment save one purely literary, artificial, and barren.
 He insists on the hopelessness of the stage, unless men prepared
 themselves at every part for a grand return to nature. We have seen
 what is his counsel to the actor. He preaches in the same key to the
 scene-painter and the maker of costumes. Scene-painting ought to be
 more rigorously true than any other kind of picture. Let there be no
 distraction, no extraneous suggestion, to interfere with the
 impression intended by the poet. Have you a salon to represent? Let it
 be that of a man of taste and no more: no ostentation and no gilding,
 unless the situation expressly demands the contrary.</p>

 <p>In the dresses the same rule holds good. Under robes that are
 overladen with gold lace, I only see a rich man; what I want to see is
 a man. Pretty and simple draperies of severe tints are what we need,
 not a mass of tinsel and embroidery. "A courageous actress has just
 got rid of her panier, and nobody has found her any the worse for it.
 Ah, if she only dared one day to show herself on the stage with all
 the nobility and simplicity of adjustment that her characters demand;
 nay, in the disorder into which she would be thrown by an event so
 terrible as the death of a husband, the loss of a son, and the other
 catastrophes of the tragic stage, what would become, round her
 dishevelled figure, of all those powdered, curled, frizzled,
 tricked-out creatures? Sooner or later they must put themselves in
 unison. O nature, nature! We can never resist her."<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

 <p>From all this we turn, for a few moments only, and not too
 cheerfully, to the Serbonian bog of dramatic rules and the metaphysics
 of the theatre. There is no subject in literature, not even the
 interpretation of the Apocalypse, which has given birth to such
 pedantic, dismal, and futile discussion. The immense controversy,
 carried on in books, pamphlets, sheets and flying articles, mostly
 German, as to what it was that Aristotle really meant by the famous
 words in the sixth chapter of the <i>Poetics</i>, about tragedy
 accomplishing the purification of our moods of pity and sympathetic
 fear, is one of the disgraces of human intelligence, a grotesque
 monument of sterility. The great tap-root of fallacy has been and
 remains the incessant imputation of ethical or social purpose to the
 dramatist, and the demand of direct and combined ethical or social
 effect from the drama. There is no critic, from the great Aristotle
 downwards, who has steered quite clear of these evil shallows;
 Diderot, as we have seen, least of all. But Diderot disarms the
 impatience which narrower critics kindle, by this magnificent
 concession, coming at the close of all: "Especially remember that
 <i>there is no general principle;</i> I do not know a single one of
 those that I have indicated which a man of genius cannot infringe with
 success."<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id=
 "FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class=
 "fnanchor">[286]</a> Here we listen to the
 voice of the genuine Diderot; and if this be granted, we need not give
 more than a passing attention to the rules that have gone before—about
 the danger of borrowing in the same composition the shades both of the
 comic and of the tragic styles; about movement being injurious to
 dignity, and of the importance therefore of not making the principal
 personage the <i>machinist</i> of the piece; about the inexpediency of
 episodic personages —and so forth. The only remark worth making on
 these propositions is that, whatever their value may be, Diderot at
 any rate, like a true philosopher, generalised from the facts of
 nature and art. He did not follow the too common critical method of
 reading one's own ideas into a work of art, and then taking them back
 again in the more imposing form of inevitable deductions from the work
 itself.</p>

 <p>What Diderot conceived himself really to have done, was to have
 sketched and constituted a new species in the great dramatic kingdom.
 Every one knows, he said, that there is tragedy and that there is
 comedy, but we have to learn that there is room in nature and the art
 of the stage for a third division, namely, the <i>genre sérieux</i>, a
 kind of comedy that has for its object virtue and the duties of man.
 Why should the writer of comedy confine his work to what is vicious or
 ridiculous in men? Why should not the duties of men furnish the
 dramatist with as ample material as their vices? Surely in the
 <i>genre honnête et sérieux</i> the subject is as important as in gay
 comedy. The characters are as varied and as original. The passions are
 all the more energetic as the interest will be greater. The style will
 be graver, loftier, more forcible, more susceptible of what we call
 sentiment, a quality without which no style ever yet spoke to the
 heart. The ridiculous will not be absent, for the madness of actions
 and speeches, when they are suggested by the misunderstanding of
 interests or by the transport of passion, is the truly ridiculous
 thing in men and in life.<a name="FNanchor_287_287"
 id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class=
 "fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

 <p>Besides his own two pieces, Diderot would probably have pointed to
 Terence as the author coming nearest to the <i>genre sérieux</i>. If
 Goethe's bad play of <i>Stella</i> had retained the close as he
 originally wrote it, with the bigamous Fernando in the last scene
 rejoicing over the devoted agreement of the two ladies and his
 daughter to live with him in happy unity, that would perhaps have been
 a comedy of the <i>genre sérieux</i>, with the duties of man
 gracefully adapted to circumstances.</p>

 <p>The theory of the <i>genre sérieux</i> has not led to the formation
 of any school of writers adopting it and working it out, or to the
 production of any masterpiece that has held its ground, as has
 happened in tragedy, comedy, and farce. Beaumarchais, who at last
 achieved such a dazzling and portentous success by one dramatic
 masterpiece, began his career as a playwright by following the vein of
 <i>The Father of the Family;</i> but <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>,
 though not without strong traces of Diderotian sentiment in pungent
 application, yet is in its structure and composition less French than
 Spanish. It is quite true, as Rosenkranz says, that the prevailing
 taste on the French stage in our own times favours above all else
 bourgeois romantic comedy, written in prose.<a name=
 "FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> But the strength of the romantic element in them
 would have been as little satisfactory to Diderot's love of realistic
 moralising as the conventional tragedy of the court of Lewis XIV. The
 Fable of most of them turns on adultery, and this is not within the
 method of the <i>genre sérieux</i> as expounded by Diderot. Perhaps
 half a dozen comedies, such, for instance, as <i>The Ideas of Madame
 Aubray,</i> by M. Dumas, are of the <i>genre sérieux</i>, but
 certainly there are not enough of such comedies to constitute a
 genuine Diderotian school in France. There is no need therefore to say
 more about the theory than this, namely, that though the drama is an
 imitative art, yet besides imitation its effects demand illusion.
 What, cries Diderot, you do not conceive the effect that would be
 produced on you by a real scene, with real dresses, with speech in
 true proportion to the action, with the actions themselves simple,
 with the very dangers that have made you tremble for your parents, for
 your friends, for yourselves? No, we answer: reproduction of reality
 does not move us as a powerful work of imagination moves us. "We may
 as well urge," said Burke, "that stones, sand, clay, and metals lie in
 a certain manner in the earth, as a reason for building with these
 materials and in that manner, as for writing according to the
 accidental disposition of characters in Nature."<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id=
 "FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class=
 "fnanchor">[289]</a> Common dangers do not
 excite us; it is the presentation of danger in some uncommon form, in
 some new combination, in some fresh play of motive and passion, that
 quickens that sympathetic fear and pity which it is the end of a play
 to produce. And if this be so, there is another thing to be said. If
 we are to be deliberately steeped in the atmosphere of Duty, illusion
 is out of place. The constant presence of that severe and overpowering
 figure, "Stern Daughter of the Voice of God," checks the native
 wildness of imagination, restricts the exuberance of fancy, and sets a
 rigorous limit to invention. Diderot used to admit that the <i>genre
 sérieux</i> could never take its right place until it had been handled
 by a man of high dramatic genius. The cause why this condition has
 never come to pass is simply that its whole structure and its
 regulations repel the faculties of dramatic genius.</p>

 <p>Besides the perfection of the <i>genre sérieux</i>, Diderot
 insisted that the following tasks were also to be achieved before the
 stage could be said to have attained the full glory of the other arts.
 First, a domestic or bourgeois tragedy must be created. Second, the
 conditions of men, their callings and situations, the types of
 classes, in short, must be substituted for mere individual characters.
 Third, a real tragedy must be introduced upon the lyric theatre.
 Finally, the dance must be brought within the forms of a true
 poem.</p>

 <p>The only remark to be made upon this scheme touches the second
 article of it. To urge the substitution of types of classes for
 individual character was the very surest means that could have been
 devised for bringing back the conventional forms of the pseudo-classic
 drama. The very mark of that drama was that it introduced types
 instead of vigorously stamped personalities. What would be gained by
 driving the typical king off the stage, only to make room for the
 generalisation of a shopkeeper? This was not the path that led to
 romanticism, to André Chenier, to De Vigny, to Lamartine, to Victor
 Hugo. Théophile Gautier has told us that the fiery chiefs of the
 romantic school who suddenly conquered France at the close of the
 Restoration, divided the whole world into <i>flamboyant</i> and
 <i>drab</i>. In the literature of the past they counted Voltaire one
 of the Drab, and Diderot a Flamboyant.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id=
 "FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class=
 "fnanchor">[290]</a> If it be not too presumptuous in a foreigner to
 dissent, we cannot but think that they were mistaken. Nothing could be
 farther removed at every part from Diderot's dramatic scheme, than
 <i>Faust</i> or <i>Götz von Berlichingen</i> or <i>Hernani</i>.</p>

 <p>The truth is that it was impossible for an effective antagonism to
 the classic school to rise in the mind of an Encyclopædist, for the
 reason that the Encyclopædists hated and ignored what they called the
 Dark Ages. Yet it was exactly the Dark Ages from which the great
 romantic revival drew its very life-breath. "In the eighteenth
 century," it has been said, "it was really the reminiscence of the
 classic spirit which was awakened in the newer life of Europe, and
 made prominent."<a name="FNanchor_291_291"
 id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class=
 "fnanchor">[291]</a> This is true in a certain historic sense of
 Rousseau's politics, and perhaps of Voltaire's rationalism. In spite
 of the vein of mysticism which occasionally shows in him, it is true
 in some degree of Diderot himself, if by classicism we mean the
 tendency to make man the centre of the universe. Classicism treats man
 as worthy and great, living his life among cold and neutral forces.
 This is the very opposite of the sinfulness, imperfection, and
 nothingness habitually imputed to man, and the hourly presence of a
 whole hierarchy of busy supernatural agents placed about man by the
 Middle Ages. Yet we cannot but see that Diderot was feeling for
 dramatic forms and subjects that would have been as little classic as
 romantic. He failed in the search. There is one play and only one of
 his epoch that is not classic, and is not romantic, but speaks
 independently the truest and best mind of the eighteenth century
 itself, in its own form and language. That play is <i>Nathan the
 Wise</i>.</p>

 RAMEAU'S NEPHEW.</h2>

 <p>In hypochondriacal moments, it has been said, the world, viewed
 from the æsthetic side, appears to many a one a cabinet of
 caricatures; from the intellectual side, a madhouse; and from the
 moral side, a harbouring place for rascals.<a name=
 "FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> We might perhaps extend this saying beyond the
 accidents of hypochondriasis, and urge that the few wide, profound,
 and real observers of human life have all known, and known often, this
 fantastic consciousness of living in a strange distorted universe of
 lunatics, knaves, grotesques. It is an inevitable mood to any who dare
 to shake the kaleidoscopic fragments out of their conventional and
 accepted combination. Who does not remember deep traces of such a mood
 in Plato, Shakespeare, Pascal, Goethe? And Diderot, who went near to
 having something of the deep quality of those sovereign spirits, did
 not escape, any more than they, the visitation of the misanthropic
 spectre. The distinction of the greater minds is that they have no
 temptation to give the spectre a permanent home with them, as is done
 by theologians in order to prove the necessity of grace and another
 world, or by cynics in order to prove the wisdom of selfishness in
 this world. The greater minds accept the worse facts of character for
 what they are worth, and bring them into a right perspective with the
 better facts. They have no expectation of escaping all perplexities,
 nor of hitting on answers to all the moral riddles of the world. Yet
 are they ever drawn by an invincible fascination to the feet of the
 mighty Sphinx of society. She bewilders them with questions that are
 never overheard by common ears, and torments them with a mockery that
 is unobserved by common eyes. The energetic—a Socrates, a
 Diderot—cannot content themselves with merely recording her
 everlasting puzzles; still less with merely writing over again the
 already recorded answers. They insist on scrutinising the moral world
 afresh; they resolve the magniloquent vocabulary of abstract ethics
 into the small realities from which it has come; they break the
 complacent repose of opinion and usage by a graphic irony. "The
 definitions of moral beings," said Diderot, "are always made from what
 such beings ought to be, and never from what they are. People
 incessantly confound duty with the thing as it is."<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> We shall proceed to
 give a short account of one or two dialogues in which he endeavours to
 keep clear of this confusion.</p>

 <p>By far the most important of these is <i>Rameau's Nephew</i>. The
 fortunes of this singular production are probably unique in literary
 history. In the year 1804</p>

 <p>Schiller handed to Goethe the manuscript of a piece by Diderot,
 with the wish that he might find himself able to translate it into
 German. "As I had long," says Goethe, "cherished a great regard for
 this author, I cheerfully undertook the task, after looking through
 the original. People can see, I hope, that I threw my whole soul into
 it."<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id=
 "FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class=
 "fnanchor">[294]</a> When he had done his
 work, he returned the manuscript to Schiller. Schiller died almost
 immediately (May 1805), and the mysterious manuscript disappeared.
 Goethe could never learn either whence it had come, or whither it
 went. He always suspected that the autograph original had been sent to
 the Empress Catherine at St. Petersburg, and that Schiller's
 manuscript was a copy from that. Though Goethe had executed his
 translation, as he says, "not merely with readiness but even with
 passion," the violent and only too just hatred then prevailing in
 Germany for France and for all that belonged to France, hindered any
 vogue which <i>Rameau's Nephew</i> might otherwise have had. On the
 eve of Austerlitz and of Jena there might well be little humour for a
 satire from the French.</p>

 <p>Thirteen years afterwards an edition of Diderot's works appeared in
 Paris (Belin's edition of 1818), but the editors were obliged to
 content themselves, for <i>Rameau's Nephew</i>, with an analysis of
 Goethe's translation. In 1821 a lively sensation was produced by the
 publication of what professed to be the original text of the missing
 dialogue. It was really a retranslation into French from Goethe. The
 fraud was not discovered for some time, until in 1823 Brière announced
 for his edition of Diderot's works a reprint from a genuine original.
 This original he had procured from Madame de Vandeul, Diderot's
 daughter, who still survived. She described it as a copy made in 1760
 under the author's own eyes, and this may have been the case, though,
 if so, it must, from some of the references, have been revised after
 1773. The two young men who had tried to palm off their retranslation
 from Goethe as Diderot's own text, at once had the effrontery to
 accuse Brière and Diderot's daughter of repeating their own fraud. A
 vivacious dispute followed between the indignant publisher and his
 impudent detractors. At length Brière appealed to the great Jove of
 Weimar. Goethe expressed his conviction that Brière's text was the
 genuine text of the original, and this was held to settle the
 question. Yet Goethe's voucher for its correspondence with the copy
 handed to him by Schiller was not really decisive evidence. He admits
 that he executed the translation very rapidly, and had no time to
 compare it closely with the French. An identification nearly twenty
 years afterwards of verbal resemblances and minute references, in a
 work that had been only a short time in his hands, cannot be counted
 testimony of the highest kind. We have thus the extraordinary
 circumstance that for a great number of years, down almost to the
 present decade, the text of the one masterpiece of a famous man who
 died so recently as 1784 rested on a single manuscript, and that a
 manuscript of disputed authenticity.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

 <p>Critics differ extremely in their answers to the question of the
 subject or object of Diderot's singular "farce-tragedy." One declares
 it to be merely a satirical picture of contemporary manners. Another
 insists that it is meant to be an ironical <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>
 of the theory of self-interest, by exhibiting a concrete example of
 its working in all its grossness. A third holds that it was composed
 by way of rejoinder to Palissot's comedy <i>(Les Philosophes</i>),
 1760, which had brought the chiefs of the rationalistic school upon
 the stage, and presented them as enemies of the human race. A fourth
 suspects that the personal and dramatic portions are no more than a
 setting for the discussion of the comparative merits of the French and
 Italian schools of music. The true answer is that the dialogue is all
 of these things, because it is none of them. It is neither more nor
 less than the living picture and account of an original, drawn by a
 man of genius who was accustomed to observe human nature and society
 with a free unblinking vision, and to meditate upon them deeply and
 searchingly.</p>

 <p>Diderot goes to work with Rameau in some sort and to a certain
 extent as Shakespeare went to work with Falstaff. He is the artist,
 reproducing with the variety and perfection of art a whimsical figure
 that struck his fancy and stirred the creative impulse. Ethics,
 æsthetics, manners, satire, are all indeed to be found in the
 dialogue, but they are only there as incident to the central figure of
 the sketch, the prodigy of parasites. Diderot had no special fondness
 for these originals. Yet he had a keen and just sense of their
 interest. "Their character stands out from the rest of the world, it
 breaks that tiresome uniformity which our bringing up, our social
 conventions, and our arbitrary fashions have introduced. If one of
 them makes his appearance in a company, he is like leaven, fermenting
 and restoring to each person present a portion of his natural
 individuality. He stirs people up, moves them, provokes to praise or
 blame: he is a means of bringing out reality; gives honest people a
 chance of showing what they are made of, and unmasks the
 rogues."<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id=

 <p>Hearing that the subject of Diderot's dialogue is the Parasite, the
 scholar will naturally think of that savage satire in which Juvenal
 rehearses the thousand humiliations that Virro inflicts on Trebius:
 how the wretched follower has to drink fiery stuff from broken
 crockery, while the patron quaffs of the costliest from splendid cups
 of amber and precious stones; how the host has fine oil of Venafrum,
 while the guest munches cabbage that has been steeped in rancid
 lamp-oil; one plays daintily with mullet and lamprey, while the other
 has his stomach turned by an eel as long as a snake, and bloated in
 the foul torrent of the sewers; Virro has apples that might have come
 from the gardens of the Hesperides, while Trebius gnaws such musty
 things as are tossed to a performing monkey on the town wall. But the
 distance is immeasurable between Juvenal's scorching truculence and
 Diderot's half-ironical, half-serious sufferance. Juvenal knows that
 Trebius is a base and abject being; he tells him what he is; and in
 the process blasts him. Diderot knows that Rameau too is base and
 abject, but he is so little willing to rest in the fat and easy
 paradise of conventions, that he seems to be all the time vaguely
 wondering in his own mind how far this genius of grossness and paradox
 and bestial sophism is a pattern of the many, with the mask thrown
 off. He seems to be inwardly musing whether it can after all be true,
 that if one draws aside a fold of the gracious outer robe of
 conformity, there is no comeliness of life shining underneath, but
 only this horror of the skeleton and the worm. He restrains
 exasperation at the brilliant effrontery of his man, precisely as an
 anatomist would suppress disgust at a pathological monstrosity, or an
 astonishing variation in which he hoped to surprise some vital secret.
 Rameau is not crudely analysed as a vile type: he is searched as
 exemplifying on a prodigious scale elements of character that lie
 furtively in the depths of characters that are not vile. It seems as
 if Diderot unconsciously anticipated that terrible, that woful, that
 desolating saying,—<i>There is in every man and woman something which,
 if you knew it, would make you hate them</i>. Rameau is not all
 parasite. He is your brother and mine, a product from the same
 rudimentary factors of mental composition, a figure cast equally with
 ourselves in one of the countless moulds of the huge social
 foundry.</p>

 <p>Such is the scientific attitude of mind towards character: It is
 not philanthropic nor pitiful: the fact that base characters exist and
 are of intelligible origin is no reason why we should not do our best
 to shun and to extirpate them. This assumption of the scientific point
 of view, this change from mere praise and blame to scrutiny, this
 comprehension that mere execration is not the last word, is a mark of
 the modern spirit. Besides Juvenal, another writer of genius has shown
 us the parasite of an ancient society. Lucian, whose fertility, wit,
 invention, mockery, freshness of spirit, and honest hatred of false
 gods, make him the Voltaire of the second century, has painted with
 all his native liveliness more than one picture of the parasite. The
 great man's creature at Rome endures exactly the same long train of
 affronts and humiliations as the great man's creature at Paris sixteen
 centuries later, beginning with the anguish of the mortified stomach,
 as savoury morsels of venison or boar are given to more important
 guests, and ending with the anguish of the mortified spirit, as he
 sees himself supplanted by a rival of shapelier person, a more
 ingenious versifier, a cleverer mountebank. The dialogue in which
 Lucian ironically proves that Parasitic, or the honourable craft of
 Spunging, has as many of the marks of a genuine art as Rhetoric,
 Gymnastic, or Music, is a spirited parody of Socratic catechising and
 Platonic mannerisms. Simo shows to Tychiades, as ingeniously as Rameau
 shows to Diderot, that the Spunger has a far better life of it, and is
 a far more rational and consistent person than the orator and the
 philosopher.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id=
 "FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class=
 "fnanchor">[297]</a> Lucian's satire is vivid, brilliant, and
 diverting. Yet every one feels that Diderot's performance, while
 equally vivid, is marked by greater depth of spirit; comes from a soil
 that has been more freely broken up, and has been enriched by a more
 copious experience. The ancient turned upon these masterpieces of
 depravation the flash of intellectual scorn; the modern eyes them with
 a certain moral patience, and something of that curious kind of
 interest, looking half like sympathy, which a hunter has for the
 object of his chase.</p>

 <p>The Rameau of the dialogue was a real personage, and there is a
 dispute whether Diderot has not calumniated him. Evidence enough
 remains that he was at least a person of singular character and
 irregular disastrous life. Diderot's general veracity of temperament
 would make us believe that his picture is authentic, but the interest
 of the dialogue is exactly the same in either case. Juvenal's fifth
 satire would be worth neither more nor less, however much were found
 out about Trebius.</p>

 <p>"Rameau is one of the most eccentric figures in the country, where
 God has not made them lacking. He is a mixture of elevation and
 lowness, of good sense and madness; the notions of good and bad must
 be mixed up together in strange confusion in his head, for he shows
 the good qualities that nature has bestowed on him without any
 ostentation, and the bad ones without the smallest shame. For the
 rest, he is endowed with a vigorous frame, a particular warmth of
 imagination, and an uncommon strength of lungs. If you ever meet him,
 unless you happen to be arrested by his originality, you will either
 stuff your fingers into your ears or else take to your heels. Heavens,
 what a monstrous pipe! Nothing is so little like him as himself. One
 time he is lean and wan, like a patient in the last stage of
 consumption: you could count his teeth through his cheeks; you would
 say he must have passed some days without tasting a morsel, or that he
 is fresh from La Trappe. A month after, he is stout and sleek as if he
 had been sitting all the time at the board of a financier, or had been
 shut up in a Bernardine monastery. To-day in dirty linen, his clothes
 torn and patched, with barely a shoe to his foot, he steals along with
 a bent head; one is tempted to hail him and toss him a shilling.
 To-morrow, all powdered, curled, in a good coat, he marches about with
 head erect and open mien, and you would almost take him for a decent
 worthy creature. He lives from day to day, from hand to mouth,
 downcast or sad, just as things may go. His first care of a morning
 when he gets up is to know where he will dine; after dinner, he begins
 to think where he may pick up a supper. Night brings disquiets of its
 own. Either he climbs to a shabby garret he has, unless the landlady,
 weary of waiting for her rent, has taken the key away from him; or
 else he shrinks to some tavern on the outskirts of the town, where he
 waits for daybreak over a crust of bread and a mug of beer. When he
 has not threepence in his pocket, as sometimes happens, he has
 recourse either to a hackney-carriage belonging to a friend, or to a
 coachman of some man of quality, who gives him a bed on the straw
 beside the horses. In the morning he still has bits of the mattress in
 his hair. If the weather is mild, he measures the Champs Elysées all
 night long. With the day he reappears in the town, dressed over night
 for the morrow, and from the morrow sometimes dressed for the rest of
 the week."</p>

 <p>Diderot is accosted by this curious being one afternoon on a bench
 in front of the Café de la Régence in the Palais Royal. They proceed
 in the thoroughly natural and easy manner of interlocutors in a
 Platonic dialogue. It is not too much to say that <i>Rameau's
 Nephew</i> is the most effective and masterly use of that form of
 discussion since Plato. Diderot's vein of realism is doubtless in
 strong contrast with Plato's poetic and idealising touch. Yet
 imaginative strokes are not wanting to soften the repulsive theme, and
 to bring the sordid and the foul within the sphere of art. For an
 example. "Time has passed," says Rameau, "and that is always so much
 gained."</p>

 <p>"<i>I.</i>—So much lost, you mean.</p>

 <p>"<i>He.</i>—No, no; gained. People grow rich every moment; a day
 less to live, or a crown piece to the good, 'tis all one. When the
 last moment comes, one is as rich as another. Samuel Bernard, who by
 pillaging and stealing and playing bankrupt, leaves seven-and-twenty
 million francs in gold, is no better than Rameau, who leaves not a
 penny, and will be indebted to charity for a shroud to wrap about him.
 The dead man hears not the tolling of the bell; 'tis in vain that a
 hundred priests bawl dirges for him, in vain that a long file of
 blazing torches go before. His soul walks not by the side of the
 master of the funeral ceremonies. To moulder under marble, or to
 moulder under clay, 'tis still to moulder. To have around one's bier
 children in red and children in blue, or to have not a creature, what
 matters it?"</p>

 <p>These are the gleams of the <i>mens divinior</i>, that relieve the
 perplexing moral squalor of the portrait. Even here we have the
 painful innuendo that a thought which is solemnising and holy to the
 noble, serves equally well to point a trait of cynical defiance in the
 ignoble.</p>

 <p>Again, there is an indirectly imaginative element in the sort of
 terror which the thoroughness of the presentation inspires. For indeed
 it is an emotion hardly short of terror that seizes us, as we listen
 to the stringent unflinching paradox of this heterogeneous figure.
 Rameau is the squalid and tattered Satan of the eighteenth century. He
 is a Mephistopheles out at elbows, a Lucifer in low water; yet always
 diabolic, with the bright flash of the pit in his eye. Disgust is
 transformed into horror and affright by the trenchant confidence of
 his spirit, the daring thoroughness and consistency of his dialectic,
 the lurid sarcasm, the vile penetration. He discusses a horrible
 action, or execrable crime, as a virtuoso examines a statue or a
 painting. He has that rarest fortitude of the vicious, not to shrink
 from calling his character and conduct by their names. He is one of
 Swift's Yahoos, with the courage of its opinions. He seems to give one
 reason for hating and dreading oneself. The effect is of mixed fear
 and fascination, as of a magician whose miraculous crystal is to show
 us what and how we shall be twenty years from now; or as when a
 surgeon tells the tale of some ghastly disorder, that may at the very
 moment be stealthily preparing for us a doom of anguish.</p>

 <p>Hence our dialogue is assuredly no "meat for little people nor for
 fools." Some of it is revolting in its brutal indecency. Even Goethe's
 self-possession cannot make it endurable to him. But it is a study to
 be omitted by no one who judges the corruption of the old society in
 France an important historic subject. The picture is very like the
 corruption of the old society in Rome. We see the rotten material
 which the purifying flame of Jacobinism was soon to consume out of the
 land with fiery swiftness. We watch the very classes from which, as we
 have been so often told, the regeneration of France would have come,
 if only demagogues and rabble had not violently interposed. There is
 no gaiety in the style; none of that laughter which makes such a
 delineation of the manners of the time as we find in Collé's play of
 <i>Truth in Wine</i>, <i>naïf</i>, true to nature, and almost
 exhilarating. In <i>Rameau</i> we are afflicted by the odour of deadly
 taint.</p>

 <p>As the dialogue is not in every hand—nor could any one wish that it
 should be—I have thought it worth while to print an English rendering
 of a considerable part of it in an appendix. Mr. Carlyle told us long
 ago that it must be translated into English, and although such a piece
 of work is less simple than it may seem, it appears right to give the
 reader an opportunity of judging for himself of the flavour of the
 most characteristic of all Diderot's performances. Only let no reader
 turn to it who has any invincible repugnance to that curious turn for
 <i>wildbret</i>, which Goethe has described as the secret of some
 arts.</p>

 <div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
   <span>Dixeris hæc inter varicosos centuriones,<br /></span>

  </div>
 </div>

 <p>As I have already said, it must be judged as something more than a
 literary diversion. "You do not suspect, Sir Philosopher," says
 Rameau, "that at this moment I represent the most important part of
 the town and the court." As the painter of the picture says, Rameau
 confessed the vices that he had, and that most of the people about us
 have; but he was no hypocrite. He was neither more nor less abominable
 than they; he was only more frank and systematic and profound in his
 depravity. This is the social significance of the dialogue. This is
 what, apart from other considerations, makes <i>Rameau's Nephew</i> so
 much more valuable a guide to the moral sentiment of the time than
 merely licentious compositions like those of Louvet or La Olos. Its
 instructiveness is immense to those who examine the conditions that
 prepared the Revolution. Rameau is not the ακόλστος of Aristotle, nor
 the creature of απονοία described by Theophrastus—the castaway by
 individual idiosyncrasy, the reprobate by accident. The men whom he
 represented, the courtiers, the financiers, the merchants, the
 shopkeepers, were immoral by formula and depraved on principle. Vice
 was a doctrine to them, and wretchlessness of unclean living was
 reduced to a system of philosophy. Any one, I venture to repeat, who
 realises the extent to which this had corroded the ruling powers in
 France, will perceive that the furious flood of social energy which
 the Jacobins poured over the country was not less indispensable to
 France than the flood of the barbarians was indispensable for the
 transformation of the Roman Empire.</p>

 <p>Scattered among the more serious fragments of the dialogue is some
 excellent by-play of sarcasm upon Palissot, and one or two of the
 other assailants of the new liberal school. Palissot is an old story.
 The Palissots are an eternal species. The family never dies out, and
 it thrives in every climate. All societies know the literary dangler
 in great houses, and the purveyor to fashionable prejudices. Not that
 he is always servile. The reader, I daresay, remembers that La Bruyère
 described a curious being in Troilus, the despotic parasite. Palissot,
 eighteenth century or nineteenth century, is often like Troilus,
 parasite and tyrant at the same time. He usually happens to have begun
 life with laudable aspirations and sincere interests of his own; and
 when, alas, the mediocrity of his gifts proves too weak to bear the
 burden of his ambitions, the recollection of a generous youth only
 serves to sour old age.</p>

 <div class="poem">

 </div>

 <p>Palissot began with a tragedy. He proceeded to an angry pamphlet
 against the Encyclopædists and the fury for innovation. Then he
 achieved immense vogue among fine ladies, bishops, and the lighter
 heads of the town, by the comedy in which he held Diderot, D'Alembert,
 and the others, up to hatred and ridicule. Finally, after coming to
 look upon himself as a serious personage, he disappeared into the mire
 of half-oblivious contempt and disgust that happily awaits all the
 poor Palissots and all their works. His name only survives in
 connection with the men whom he maligned. He lived to be old, as,
 oddly enough, Spite so often does. In the Terror he had a narrow
 escape, for he was brought before Chaumette. Chaumette apostrophised
 the assailant of Rousseau and Diderot with rude energy, but did not
 send him to the guillotine. In this the practical disciple only
 imitated the magnanimity of his theoretical masters. Rousseau had
 declined an opportunity of punishing Palissot's impertinences, and
 Diderot took no worse vengeance upon him than by making an occasional
 reference of contempt to him in a dialogue which he perhaps never
 intended to publish.</p>

 <p>Another subject is handled in <i>Rameau's Nephew,</i> which is
 interesting in connection with the mental activity of Paris in the
 eighteenth century. Music was the field of as much passionate
 controversy as theology and philosophy. The Bull Unigenitus itself did
 not lead to livelier disputes, or more violent cabals, than the
 conflict between the partisans of French music and the partisans of
 Italian music. The horror of a Jansenist for a Molinist did not
 surpass that of a Lullist for a Dunist, or afterwards of a Gluckist
 for a Piccinist.<a name=
 "FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Lulli and Rameau (the uncle of our parasite) had
 undisputed possession of Paris until the arrival, in 1752, of a
 company of Italian singers. The great quarrel at once broke out as to
 the true method and destination of musical composition. Is music an
 independent art, appealing directly to a special sense, or is it to be
 made an instrument for expressing affections of the mind in a certain
 deeper way? The Italians asked only for delicious harmonies and
 exquisite melodies. The French insisted that these should be
 subordinate to the work of the poet. The former were content with
 delight, the latter pressed for significance. The one declared that
 Italian music was no better than a silly tickling of the ears; the
 other that the overture to a French opera was like a prelude to a
 Miserere in plain-song. In 1772-73 the illustrious Gluck came to
 Paris. His art was believed to reconcile the two schools, to have more
 melody than the old French style, and more severity and meaning than
 the purely Italian style. French dignity was saved. But soon the old
 battle, which had been going on for twenty years, began to rage with
 greater violence than ever. Piccini was brought to Paris by the
 Neapolitan ambassador. The old cries were heard in a shriller key than
 before. Pamphlets, broadsheets, sarcasms flew over Paris from every
 side.</p>

 <p>Was music only to flatter the ear, or was it to paint the passions
 in all their energy, to harrow the soul, to raise men's courage, to
 form citizens and heroes? The coffee-houses were thrown into dire
 confusion, and literary societies were rent by fatal discord. Even
 dinner-parties breathed only constraint and mistrust, and the
 intimacies of a lifetime came to cruel end. <i>Rameau's Nephew</i> was
 composed in the midst of the first part of this long campaign of a
 quarter of a century, and its seems to have been revised by its author
 in the midst of the second great episode. Diderot declares against the
 school of Rameau and Lulli. That he should do so was a part of his
 general reaction in favour of what he called the natural, against the
 artifice and affectation. Goethe has pointed out the inconsistency
 between Diderot's sympathy for the less expressive kind of music, and
 his usual vehement passion for the expressive in art. He truly
 observes that Diderot's sympathy went in this way, because the novelty
 and agitation seemed likely to break up the old, stiff, and abhorred
 fashion, and to clear the ground afresh for other efforts.<a name=

  book that was famous in its day, <i>Les Ruines, ou Méditation sur les
  révolutions des empires</i> (1791), resorted to a slight difference
  of method. Instead of leaving the pretensions of the various creeds
  to cancel one another, he invented a rather striking scene, in which
  the priests of each creed are made to listen to the professions of
  their rival, and then inveigh against his superstition and
  inconsistency. The assumption on which Diderot's argument rests is,
  that as so many different creeds all make the same exclusive claim,
  the claim is equally false throughout. Volney's argument turns more
  directly on the merits, and implies that all religions are equally
  morbid or pathological products, because they all lead to conduct
  condemned by their own most characteristic maxims. Volney's concrete
  presentation of comparative religion was highly effective for
  destructive purposes, though it would now be justly thought
  inadequate. (See <i>Œuv. de Volney</i>, i. 109, etc.)</p>

  remember that torture was not abolished in France until the
  Revolution. A Catholic writer makes the following judicious remark:
  "We cannot study the eighteenth century without being struck by the
  immoral consequences that inevitably followed for the population of
  Paris from the frequency and the hideous details of criminal
  executions. In reading the journals of the time, we are amazed at the
  place taken in popular life by the scenes of the Grève. It was the
  theatre of the day. The gibbet and the wheel did their work almost
  periodically, and people looked on while poor wretches writhed in
  slow agony all day long. Sometimes the programme was varied by
  decapitation and even by the stake. Torture had its legends and its
  heroes—the everyday talk of the generation which, having begun by
  seeing Damiens torn by red-hot pincers, was to end by rending Foulon
  limb from limb." (Carné, <i>Monarchie française au 18ième Siècle</i>,
  p. 493.)</p>

  that the man would not distinguish the cube from the sphere, until he
  had identified by actual touch the source of his former tactual
  impression with the object making a given visual impression.
  Condillac, while making just objections to the terms in which
  Molyneux propounded the question, answered it different from Locke.
  Diderot expresses his own opinion thus: "I think that when the eyes
  of the born-blind are opened for the first time to the light, he will
  perceive nothing at all; that some time will be necessary for his eye
  to make experiments for itself; but that it will make these
  experiments itself, and in its own way, and without the help of
  touch." This is in harmony with the modern doctrine, that there is an
  inherited aptitude of structure (in the eye, for instance), but that
  experience is an essential condition to the development and
  perfecting of this aptitude.</p>

  <i>Louis XV.</i>, 258. D'Aguesseau (1668-1751) has left one piece
  which ought to be extricated from the thirteen quartos of his
  works—his memoir of his father (<i>Œuv.</i>, xiii.) This is one of
  those records of solid and elevated character, which do more to
  refresh and invigorate the reader than a whole library of religious
  or ethical exhortations can do. It has the loftiness, the refined
  austerity, the touching impressiveness of Tacitus's <i>Agricola</i>
  or Condorcet's <i>Turgot</i>, together with a certain grave sweetness
  that was almost peculiar to the Jansenist school of the seventeenth
  century.</p>

  says that the reputation of Bacon does not really go farther back
  than the Encyclopædia, and that no true discoverer either knew him or
  leaned on him for support. (<i>Examen de la Phil. de Bacon</i>, ii.
  110.) Diderot says: "I think I have taught my fellow-citizens to
  esteem and read Bacon; people have turned over the pages of this
  profound author more since the last five or six years than has ever
  been the case before" (xiv. 494). In Professor Fowler's careful and
  elaborate edition of the Novum Organum (<i>Introduct.</i>, p. 104),
  he disputes the statement of Montuola and others, that the celebrity
  of Bacon dates from the Encyclopædia. All turns upon what we mean by
  celebrity. What the Encyclopædists certainly did was to raise Bacon,
  for a time, to the popular throne from which Voltaire's Newtonianism
  had pushed Descartes. Mr. Fowler traces a chain of Baconian
  tradition, no doubt, but he perhaps surrenders nearly as much as is
  claimed when he admits that "the patronage of Voltaire and the
  Encyclopædists did much to extend the study of Bacon's writings,
  besides producing a considerable controversy as to his true meaning
  on many questions of philosophy and theology."</p>

  the military spirit of Lewis XIV. had been a great curse to Europe.

  refer to a passage in Sédaine's popular comedy, <i>The Philosopher
  without knowing it</i> (1765), Act II. sc. 4. Vanderk, among other
  things, says of the merchant: "Ce n'est pas un temple, ce n'est pas
  une seule nation qu'il sert; il les sert toutes, et en est servi:
  c'est l'homme de l'univers. Quelques particuliers audacieux font
  armer les rois, la guerre s'allume, tout s'embrase, l'Europe est
  divisée: mais ce négociant anglais, hollandais, russe ou chinois,
  n'en est pas moins l'ami de mon coeur: nous sommes sur la superficie
  de la terre autant de fils de soie qui lient ensemble les nations, et
  les ramènent à la paix par la nécessité du commerce; voila, mon fils,
  ce que c'est qu'un honnête négociant."</p>

  centuries the priestly castes of China, and still more of India, have
  been watching our Western transition; to them it must appear mere
  agitation, as puerile as it is tempestuous, with nothing to harmonise
  its different phases but their common inroad upon unity." <i>Positive

  are interested in the history of authorship may care to know the end
  of the matter. Copyright is no modern practice, and the perpetual
  right of authors, or persons to whom they had ceded it, was
  recognised in France through the whole of the seventeenth century and
  three-quarters of the eighteenth. The perpetuity of the right had
  produced literary properties of considerable value; for example,
  Boudot's Dictionary was sold by his executors for 24,000 livres;
  Prévot's Manual Lexicon and two Dictionaries for 115,000 livres. But
  in 1777—ten years after Diderot's plea—the Council decreed that
  copyright was a privilege and an exercise of the royal grace. The
  motives for this reduction of an author's right from a transferable
  property to a terminable privilege seem to have been, first, the
  general mania of the time for drawing up the threads of national life
  into the hands of the administration, and second, the hope of making
  money by a tariff of permissions. The Constituent Assembly dealt with
  the subject with no intelligence nor care, but the Convention passed
  a law recognising in the author an exclusive right for his life, and
  giving a property for ten years after his death to heirs or
  <i>cessionaires</i>. The whole history is elaborately set forth in
  the collection of documents entitled <i>La Propriété littéraire au
  18ième siècle</i>. (Hachette, 1859.)</p>

  Lichtenberg's <i>Briefe aus England</i> (1776) there is a criticism
  of the most admirably intelligent kind on Garrick. Lord Lytton gave
  an account of it to English readers in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>
  (February 1871). The following passage confirms what Diderot says
  above:</p>

  <p>"You have doubtless heard much of his extraordinary power of
  change of face. Here is one example of it. When he played the part of
  Sir John Brute, I was close to the stage, and could observe him
  narrowly. He entered with the corners of his mouth so turned down, as
  to give to his whole countenance the expression of habitual
  sottishness and debauchery. And this artificial form of the mouth he
  retained, unaltered, from the beginning to the end of the play, with
  the exception only that, as the play went on, the lips gaped and hung
  more and more in proportion to the gradually increasing drunkenness
  of the character represented. This made-up face was not produced by
  stage-paint, but solely by muscular contraction; and it must be so
  identified by Garrick with his idea of Sir John Brute as to be
  spontaneously assumed by him whenever he plays that part; otherwise,
  his retention of such a mask, without even once dropping it either
  from fatigue or surprise, even in the most boisterous action of his
  part, would be quite inexplicable."</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
